\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Previous Causal studies involving chronotype exposure}
With the advent of large biobank cohorts to provide GWAS, there have been several recent MR studies looking at the causal influence between chronotype, sleep and several physiological and behavioral traits. Lind and colleagues found significant genetic correlations between oversleeping, insomnia, and undersleeping exposures with an outcome of post traumatic stress disorder \cite{lind_molecular_2020}, but when testing for causality via did not find evidence for causal effects of sleep phenotypes on post traumatic stress. Adams and Neuhausen were interested in the interplay between chronotype and free fatty acid circulation, and also between free fatty acids and type two diabetes \cite{adams_evaluating_2019}. So as to evaluate this, they conducted a two Mendelian randomization studies using two sample data, and found that morning chronotype is associated with lower total fatty acid levels (IVW $\beta$ -0.21, p = 0.02) and that elevated fatty acid levels are associated with a decrease in diabetes, granting a protective effect (IVW $\beta$ -0.23, p = 0.01). They then extended their analysis to include subtypes of free fatty acids and their conclusions held, indicating that a morning chronotype is associated with lower mono-unsaturated fatty acid intake. Richmond and colleagues sought to model sleep traits and risk of breast cancer using Mendelian randomization methods, using chronotype, sleep duration, and insomnia GWAS for instrumental variable selection \cite{richmond_investigating_2019}. They modeled the UK Biobank in a one-sample fashion, using a two-stage least squares regression approach instead of splitting the cohort into two non-overlapping samples, and showed a morning chronotype to be protective against breast cancer (Odds Ratio 0.85). Two sample modeling with an independent cohort supported these findings, showing morning chronotype (IVW OR 0.88) was protective against breast cancer, while increased sleep duration has a detrimental effect (IVW OR 1.19). Gibson investigated bi-directional causal effects between smoking and sleep duration and chronotype \cite{gibson_evidence_2019}. They found no clear evidence that smoking initiation influenced sleep behaviors directly, nor evidence for causal effects between chronotype on smoking behavior. However, they did find evidence that insomnia could lead to an increase in smoking behavior (IVW $\beta$ 1.21, p = 0.02) in an under-powered analysis. Treur modelled caffeine consumption and sleep traits, including chronotype, sleep duration, and history of insomnia \cite{treur_investigating_2018}. While the association between caffeine consumption and disturbed sleep is well known, and their analysis did show strong genetic correlations between those traits, an extensive two sample MR using IVW and MR-Egger meta-analyses failed to produce significant causal associations. On a wider scale, Lane and colleagues used MR analysis as a follow-up to their first GWAS of chronotype using the UKBB \cite{lane_genome-wide_2016}. They found significant associations between evening phenotype and years of education increasing and self reported schizophrenia diagnosis, and associations between a morning chronotype and a decreased body mass index (BMI). 

\subsection{MR}
MR employs IV analysis for causative inference. Any causative modeling study can be graphically displayed using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) \cite{pearl_causal_nodate}. As described in Chapter 1 of this work, DAGs are directed, meaning information between two nodes of a graph must flow in one direction from node A to B, but not both. They are acyclic, meaning that on a path form A to B to C, there cannot be a path from C to A. In modeling ontologies, this assures that the transitive properties of relations are maintained and that the logic underlying deductive reasoning will not break. In causal inference and experimental design, this helps ensure that an outcome will not influence an exposure, or that a confounding variable not provide an additional path between an IV and an outcome. There are three fundamental assumptions of causative inference in the MR context which must be satisfied for an IV analysis to be valid \cite{burgess_guidelines_2020}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The IV (allele) must not associate directly with an exposure
  \item The IV must not associate with any potential confiding variables, which then associate with the outcome
  \item The IV must not associate directly with the outcome, except as mediated by the exposure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Materials and Methods}

A general workflow for this study is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:MR_Workflow}. Using the EpiGraphDB R API v1.0 \cite{liu_epigraphdb_2020}, results of precomputed Mendelian Randomization studies were obtained with the following parameters: exposure trait either "Morning/evening person (chronotype)" or "Chronotype", with a p-value threshold of 5e-8 (GWAS genome-wide signifiance). Results were filtered to significant fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted multi-snp meta-analyses (IVW), with 120 significant associations retained, and additionally manually curated to keep associations between chronotype and mental or cardiometabolic health. Chronotype/chronotype and chronotype/sleep duration studies were discarded, leaving 16 potential studies for investigation,  Figure~\ref{fig:MR_Workflow} first step.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Figs/Analysis1/outline.png}
	\caption{Mendelian Randomization (MR) workflow for testing the causal influence of chronotype on traits in the EpiGraphDB database. An unbiased search for GWAS-derived two-sample MR studies was performed with chronotype or moningness/eveningness as reported exposures, and IVW results (p < 5e-8) retained. Data used in analyses were downloaded, and potential chronotype IVs filtered with Steiger filtering, LD-clumping, and stand/palindromic SNP harmonization. IVW and related MR analyses are then performed on filtered SNP summary statistics, followed by pleiotropy (MR Egger) and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses. Associations that survive multiple testing correction are then uploaded to EpiGraphDB to investigate potential confounders not present in exposure/trait analyses as reported.}
	\label{fig:MR_Workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mendelian Randomization Investigations}

Each retained exposure's data was downloaded from MR-Base via TwoSampleMR package version 0.5.5 \cite{hemani_mr-base_2018}. For each instrumental variable (IV) SNP in the exposure study, the following procedure was performed. First, the strandedness of each GWAS was checked to make sure that at each allele, the minor and major alleles were equal. If these were reversed, effect sizes were modified to correct for this. Pallendromic SNPs, which contain alleles represented by the same base pairs on both strands of DNA, were discarded. If SNPs were not present, proxies were found using PLINK with an $R^2$ of at least 0.8, and strand was checked again \cite{plink}. Next, SNPs in the exposure GWAS set were clumped by LD to ensure statistical independence. In a window of 10000 base pairs, an $R^2$ cutoff of < 0.001 was set to obtain haplotype blocks using the European reference panel of the 10,000 Genomes Project \cite{10kgenomes}. In each exposure/outcome pair this left a variable number of SNPs for use as valid, independent IVs (see Figure~\ref{fig:MR_Workflow} top second step). Effect sizes for each SNP were reported as a $\beta$ or the transformed $log(OR)$. Then the Wald ratio was obtained, giving a measure of the effect of the exposure on the outcome: 

\begin{equation}
\widehat{\theta_j}    = \frac{\beta_{Yj}}{\beta_{Xj}}
\end{equation}

where $\beta_Y_j$ is the effect of the IV on the outcome, and $\beta_X_j$ is the effect of the IV on the exposure is obtained for SNP j, and $\widehat{\theta}$ is the effect size.

An initial IVW analysis between each exposure/outcome set was performed, with the false discovery rate (FDR) controlled for \cite{benyamin_family-based_2009}. An FDR of < 0.05 was considered significant. The IVW methods uses the Wald ratios of each SNPs as the "study" the meta-analysis, with a pooled estimate seen in the forest plots below (see results) driving home the meta-analytic nature of multi-SNP MR. Rather than calculate Wald ratios individually, the outcome GWAS $\beta$s or Odds Ratios are regressed on the exposure. The slope of the regression line indicates the strength of the effect, as an increase in the unit of outcome per unit of the exposure\cite{burgess_interpreting_2017}. 
In a IVW meta-analysis, IVW estimate is calculated by:

\begin{equaton}
\widehat{\beta}_{Yj} = \theta_{IVW}\widehat{\beta}_{Xj} + \epsilon_{Ij}; \epsilon_{Ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2se(\widehat{\beta}_{Yj})^2)
\end{equaton}

where $\widehat{\theta}$ is the inverse variance weighted average, $se$ is the standard error, and other terms are as above, and I is an error term (see Figure~\ref{fig:MR_Workflow} third step, right).

Ten significant IVW studies were then subject to four additional MR methods (see \ref{fig:MR_Workflow}, third level left).  To address unseen horizontal pleiotropy, the Egger regression was performed. \cite{bowden_framework_2017,bowdenMendelianRandomizationInvalid2015b}. The Wald ratios of each SNP are used in meta-regression by taking the inverse IVW weights used in IVW analysis, without modeling the intercept. It provides a causal estimate similar to IVW but adjusted for horizontal pleiotropy which would otherwise invalidate IVW \cite{bowdenMendelianRandomizationInvalid2015b}.
MR-Egger regression is an extension of IVW regression. Instead of assuming no intercept term, an intercept is estimated:
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\beta}_{Yj} = \theta_{0E} + \theta_{1E}\widehat{\beta}_{Xj} + \epsilon_{Ej}; \epsilon_{Ej} \sim N(0,\sigma^2se(\widehat{\beta}_{Yj})^2)
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{0E}$ is the intercept and $\theta_{1E}$ the MR Egger estimate.
If the intercept is equal to zero, then the IVW method and MR-Egger will be equivalent \cite{burgess_interpreting_2017}. During the IVW process in MR-Egger, the effect sizes of each SNP must have the same sign, and this decreases the variation between them \cite{bowdenMendelianRandomizationInvalid2015b}.

Inverse variance-weighted median analyses were performed, using the median of  Wald ratios as an effect size. Unweighted analysis assume that over half of the instruments are valid, while in an weighted median analysis the assumption is that the at least 50\% of the weight of the instruments are valid themselves \cite{bowden_consistent_2016}. This approach is robust to directional pleiotropy when compared to a simple IVW meta-analysis.

The mode-based estimator (MBE) clusters Wald ratios before calculating random effects in an IVW meta-analysis \cite{hartwigRobustInferenceSummary2017a}. The simple MBE uses unweighted analysis, while the weighted MBE uses inverse variance weighting. First, a smooth empirical density function is calculated for each Wald ratio and are then clustered. The ZEMPA assumption (Zero Modal Pleiotropy Assumption) states that the biggest cluster with the same ratio estimates will be valid instruments, and these were used in each analysis, resulting in fewer SNPs, less power, but potential robustness to horizontal pleiotropy.

Heterogeneity can occur when individual SNPs do not converge on an estimate; this was estimated by Cochran's $Q$ \cite{higgins_cochrane_2011}. In this context, heterogeneity may be a sign of horizontal pleiotropy, wherein SNPs effect the outcome by their influence on other confounding traits  \cite{burgess_review_2017}. To inspect SNPs for outliers, we performed leave-one-out sensitivity analyses using the IVW method, leaving out one SNP in each analysis. 

We used the Steiger test to access the directional of all causative analyses post-hoc \cite{hemaniOrientingCausalRelationship2017}. The Steiger test first assesses which variables (exposure or outcome) are influenced by the SNPs used, by testing if the SNPs explain more variance in the exposure than in the outcome with a modified $Z$ statistic. If the p-value of the IVW estimate and the Steiger estimate are both significant, the sign of the $Z$ statistic is used to assign the correct causal direction between exposure and outcome.

\subsection{Confounder and Intermediate Analysis}
To address potential confounders not seen in pairwise analyses even in the absence of the statistical suggestion of horizontal pleiotropy, existing MR studies were obtained from EpiGraphDB (Figure~\ref{fig:MR_Workflow} last step). Each study exposure/outcome pair with significant FDR-corrected IVW results was used to interrogate the database for intermediate, reverse intermediate, collider, and confounding variables. Results from the study database were retained if they passed a p-value threshold of < 1e-5 using a fixed effects IVW method only. The $\beta$ effect sizes for significant results between exposures and outcomes, exposures and confounders, and outcomes and confounders were used to create a weighted directed graph in Cytoscape \cite{shannon_cytoscape_2003} version 3.8.2, and the yFiles Organic (force directed) layout to visualize the relationships between traits. 

All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.0.5 \cite{r_core_team_r:_2013}.

%The salmon cluster's phenotypic makeup includes unusual sensory interests, coping with environmental changes, and asking socially inappropriate questions. It is associated with significantly interacting (Table \ref{tab:salmon.CassiSig}) and single SNPs (Table~\ref{tab:salmon.GemmaSig}, Figure~\ref{fig:salmon.manQQ}). The cluster is associated with several protein complexes (Table \ref{tab:salmon.Enrichment}).

\section{Discussion}
% Phenome-wide approach and potential criticisms
Instrumental variable analysis relies on strong assumptions, and occasionally unverifiable conditions \cite{labrecqueUnderstandingAssumptionsUnderlying2018}. Subject knowledge is the most reliable method for concluding assumptions are valid, especially when choosing exposures and outcomes correctly. A naieve, phenome-wide search for causation between traits is likely to include among many tests non-plausible experimental designs, leading to an artificial increase in multiple testing burden and design flaws.
