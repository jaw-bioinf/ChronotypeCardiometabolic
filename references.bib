	abstract = {The GWAS Catalog delivers a high-quality curated collection of all published genome-wide association studies enabling investigations to identify causal variants, understand disease mechanisms, and establish targets for novel therapies. The scope of the Catalog has also expanded to targeted and exome arrays with 1000 new associations added for these technologies. As of September 2018, the Catalog contains 5687 GWAS comprising 71673 variant-trait associations from 3567 publications. New content includes 284 full P-value summary statistics datasets for genome-wide and new targeted array studies, representing 6 × 109 individual variant-trait statistics. In the last 12 months, the Catalog's user interface was accessed by ∼90000 unique users who viewed {\textgreater}1 million pages. We have improved data access with the release of a new RESTful API to support high-throughput programmatic access, an improved web interface and a new summary statistics database. Summary statistics provision is supported by a new format proposed as a community standard for summary statistics data representation. This format was derived from our experience in standardizing heterogeneous submissions, mapping formats and in harmonizing content. Availability: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/.},

	abstract = {The wealth of data resources on human phenotypes, risk factors, molecular traits and therapeutic interventions presents new opportunities for population health sciences. These opportunities are paralleled by a growing need for data integration, curation and mining to increase research efficiency, reduce mis-inference and ensure reproducible research.We developed EpiGraphDB (https://epigraphdb.org/), a graph database containing an array of different biomedical and epidemiological relationships and an analytical platform to support their use in human population health data science. In addition, we present three case studies that illustrate the value of this platform. The first uses EpiGraphDB to evaluate potential pleiotropic relationships, addressing mis-inference in systematic causal analysis. In the second case study, we illustrate how protein–protein interaction data offer opportunities to identify new drug targets. The final case study integrates causal inference using Mendelian randomization with relationships mined from the biomedical literature to ‘triangulate’ evidence from different sources.The EpiGraphDB platform is openly available at https://epigraphdb.org. Code for replicating case study results is available at https://github.com/MRCIEU/epigraphdb as Jupyter notebooks using the API, and https://mrcieu.github.io/epigraphdb-r using the R package.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

MR depends on SNPs exhibiting vertical pleiotropy, where the SNP influences an outcome phenotype only through an exposure phenotype. Issues arise when this assumption is violated due to SNPs exhibiting horizontal pleiotropy. We demonstrate that across a range of pleiotropy models, instrument selection will be increasingly liable to selecting invalid instruments as GWAS sample sizes continue to grow. Methods have been developed in an attempt to protect MR from different patterns of horizontal pleiotropy, and here we have designed a mixture-of-experts machine learning framework (MR-MoE 1.0) that predicts the most appropriate model to use for any specific causal analysis, improving on both power and false discovery rates. Using the approach, we systematically estimated the causal effects amongst 2407 phenotypes. Almost 90\% of causal estimates indicated some level of horizontal pleiotropy. The causal estimates are organised into a publicly available graph database (http://eve.mrbase.org), and we use it here to highlight the numerous challenges that remain in automated causal inference.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, we discover 51 causal relationships, including previously known agonistic effects of urate on gout and cystatin C on stroke. Finally, we develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for each biomarker and build ‘multi-PRS’ models for diseases using 35 PRSs simultaneously, which improved chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, gout and alcoholic cirrhosis genetic risk stratification in an independent dataset (FinnGen; n = 135,500) relative to single-disease PRSs. Together, our results delineate the genetic basis of biomarkers and their causal influences on diseases and improve genetic risk stratification for common diseases.},

	abstract = {Genotype–phenotype correlations are the basis of precision medicine of human genetic diseases. However, it remains a challenge for clinicians and researchers to conveniently access detailed individual-level clinical phenotypic features of patients with various genetic variants. To address this urgent need, we manually searched for genetic studies in PubMed and catalogued 8,309 genetic variants in 1,288 genes from 17,738 patients with detailed clinical phenotypic features from 1,855 publications. Based on genotype–phenotype correlations in this dataset, we developed an user-friendly online database called GPCards (http://genemed.tech/gpcards/), which not only provided the association between genetic diseases and disease genes, but also the prevalence of various clinical phenotypes related to disease genes and the patient-level mapping between these clinical phenotypes and genetic variants. To accelerate the interpretation of genetic variants, we integrated 62 well-known variant-level and gene-level genomic data sources, including functional predictions, allele frequencies in different populations, and disease-related information. Furthermore, GPCards enables automatic analyses of users’ own genetic data, comprehensive annotation, prioritization of candidate functional variants, and identification of genotype–phenotype correlations using custom parameters. In conclusion, GPCards is expected to accelerate the interpretation of genotype–phenotype correlations, subtype classification, and candidate gene prioritisation in human genetic diseases.},

Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs, indicating their potential involvement in regulation of gene expression. Here, we propose a transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously. Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene–trait associations, 36\% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy. We also find pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections. TWMR better accounts for pleiotropy and has the potential to identify biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.},

While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation—genetic liability—has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results.

Methods HbA1c and random plasma glucose data were collected for 125 people with diabetes without liver disease and for 29 people awaiting liver transplant with diabetes and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, hereditary haemochromatosis, polycystic liver/kidneys, cryptogenic/non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and α-1-antitrypsin-related disease. Results The median (interquartile range) age of the diabetes with cirrhosis group was 55 (49–63) years compared to 60 (50–71) years (P=0.13) in the group without cirrhosis. In the diabetes with cirrhosis group there were 21 men (72\%) compared with 86 men (69\%) in the group with diabetes and no cirrhosis (P=0.82). Of the group with diabetes and cirrhosis, 27 people (93\%) were of white European ethnicity, two (7\%) were South Asian and none was of Afro-Caribbean/other ethnicity compared with 94 (75\%), 16 (13\%), 10 (8\%)/5 (4\%), respectively, in the group with diabetes and no cirrhosis (P=0.20). Median (interquartile range) HbA1c was 41 (32–56) mmol/mol [5.9 (5.1–7.3)\%] vs 61 (52–70) mmol/mol [7.7 (6.9–8.6)\%] (P{\textless}0.001), respectively, in the diabetes with cirrhosis group vs the diabetes without cirrhosis group. The glucose concentrations were 8.4 (7.0–11.2) mmol/l vs 7.3 (5.2–11.5) mmol/l (P=0.17). HbA1c was depressed by 20 mmol/mol (1.8\%; P{\textless}0.001) in 28 participants with cirrhosis but elevated by 28 mmol/mol (2.6\%) in the participant with α-1-antitrypsin disorder. Those with cirrhosis and depressed HbA1c had fewer larger erythrocytes, and higher red cell distribution width and reticulocyte count. This was reflected in the positive association of glucose with mean cell volume (r=0.39) and haemoglobin level (r=0.49) and the negative association for HbA1c (r=–0.28 and r=–0.26, respectively) in the diabetes group with cirrhosis. Conclusion HbA1c is not an appropriate test for blood glucose in people with cirrhosis and diabetes awaiting transplant as it reflects altered erythrocyte presentation.},

In recent years, efforts have been made to investigate the potential of Information and Communication Technologies to improve cognitive functioning and quality of life in older adults with and without cognitive impairments. In this paper, we propose the Aging Neuro-Behaviour Ontology (ANBO), a formal model of cognitive processes involved in day-to-day living and whose performance usually decline with age. ANBO has been created with the aim of being an aid in developing tools for cognitive rehabilitation by means of integrating aging-related behaviors with monitoring activities of daily living. As an example of these tools, we introduce an integration of ANBO with the Ontology SmartLab Elderly (OSLE), an ontology related with Telehealth Smart Homes wherein activities of daily living are recorded. This ANBO and OSLE integration enable the interpretation of these activities as the result of cognitive processes of interest in the domain of elderly decline.},

	abstract = {The master circadian pacemaker in mammals is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) which regulate physiology and behaviour, as well as coordinating peripheral clocks throughout the body. Investigating the function of the SCN has often focused on the identification of rhythmically expressed genes. However, not all genes critical for SCN function are rhythmically expressed. An alternative strategy is to characterize those genes that are selectively enriched in the SCN. Here, we examined the transcriptome of the SCN and whole brain (WB) of mice using meta-analysis of publicly deposited data across a range of microarray platforms and RNA-Seq data. A total of 79 microarrays were used (24 SCN and 55 WB samples, 4 different microarray platforms), alongside 17 RNA-Seq data files (7 SCN and 10 WB). 31 684 MGI gene symbols had data for at least one platform. Meta-analysis using a random effects model for weighting individual effect sizes (derived from differential expression between relevant SCN and WB samples) reliably detected known SCN markers. SCN-enriched transcripts identified in this study provide novel insights into SCN function, including identifying genes which may play key roles in SCN physiology or provide SCN-specific drivers.},

SNP genotyping was traditionally used to associate candidate regions with traits in the mouse, but failed to reveal novel variants without further targeted sequencing. Using a robust set of computational protocols, we present a platform to enable scientists to detect variants arising from whole-genome and exome sequencing experiments. This article guides researchers on aligning reads to the mouse genome, quality-assurance strategies, mutation discovery, comparing mutations to previously discovered mouse SNPs, and the annotation of novel variants, in order to predict mutation consequences on the protein level. Challenges unique to the mouse are discussed, and two protocols use self-contained containers to maintain version control and allow users to adapt our approach to new techniques by upgrading container versions.

	abstract = {Despite significant research, the biological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are still unclear. We shed light on structural brain differences in psychosis using an approach called morphometric similarity mapping, which quantifies the structural similarity between brain regions. Morphometric similarity was globally reduced in psychosis patients in three independent datasets, implying that patients’ brain regions were more differentiated from each other and less interconnected. Similarity was especially decreased in frontal and temporal regions. This anatomical pattern was correlated with expression of genes enriched for nervous system development and synaptic signaling and genes previously associated with schizophrenia and antipsychotic treatments. Therefore, we begin to see how combining genomics and imaging can give a more integrative understanding of schizophrenia, which might inform future treatments., Schizophrenia has been conceived as a disorder of brain connectivity, but it is unclear how this network phenotype is related to the underlying genetics. We used morphometric similarity analysis of MRI data as a marker of interareal cortical connectivity in three prior case–control studies of psychosis: in total, n = 185 cases and n = 227 controls. Psychosis was associated with globally reduced morphometric similarity in all three studies. There was also a replicable pattern of case–control differences in regional morphometric similarity, which was significantly reduced in patients in frontal and temporal cortical areas but increased in parietal cortex. Using prior brain-wide gene expression data, we found that the cortical map of case–control differences in morphometric similarity was spatially correlated with cortical expression of a weighted combination of genes enriched for neurobiologically relevant ontology terms and pathways. In addition, genes that were normally overexpressed in cortical areas with reduced morphometric similarity were significantly up-regulated in three prior post mortem studies of schizophrenia. We propose that this combined analysis of neuroimaging and transcriptional data provides insight into how previously implicated genes and proteins as well as a number of unreported genes in their topological vicinity on the protein interaction network may drive structural brain network changes mediating the genetic risk of schizophrenia.},

Here, using anatomical comparisons between histology and magnetic resonance images of the human hypothalamus in the coronal plane, we show that discrete gray and white hypothalamic structures are consistently identifiable by MRI. Macroscopic and microscopic images were used to precisely annotate the MRI sequences realized in the coronal plane in twenty healthy volunteers. MRI was performed on a 1.5T scanner, using a protocol including T1-weighted 3D fast field echo, T1-weighted inversionrecovery, turbo spin echo and T2-weighted 2D fast field echo imaging. For each gray matter structure as well as for white matter bundles, the different MRI sequences were analyzed in comparison to each other. The anterior commissure and the fornix were often identifiable, while the mammillothalamic tract was more difficult to spot. Qualitative analyses showed that MRI could also highlight finer structures such as the paraventricular nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and the infundibular (arcuate) nucleus, brain nuclei that play key roles in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis. The posterior hypothalamic area, a target for deep brain stimulation in the treatment of cluster headaches, was readily identified, as was the lateral hypothalamic area, which similar to the aforementioned hypothalamic nuclei, could be a putative target for deep brain stimulation in the treatment of obesity. Finally, each of the identified structures was mapped to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space.},

	abstract = {The current paradigm of genomic studies of complex diseases is association and correlation analysis. Despite significant progress in dissecting the genetic architecture of complex diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the identified genetic variants by GWAS can only explain a small proportion of the heritability of complex diseases. A large fraction of genetic variants is still hidden. Association analysis has limited power to unravel mechanisms of complex diseases. It is time to shift the paradigm of genomic analysis from association analysis to causal inference. Causal inference is an essential component for the discovery of mechanism of diseases. This paper will review the major platforms of the genomic analysis in the past and discuss the perspectives of causal inference as a general framework of genomic analysis. In genomic data analysis, we usually consider four types of associations: association of discrete variables (DNA variation) with continuous variables (phenotypes and gene expressions), association of continuous variables (expressions, methylations, and imaging signals) with continuous variables (gene expressions, imaging signals, phenotypes, and physiological traits), association of discrete variables (DNA variation) with binary trait (disease status) and association of continuous variables (gene expressions, methylations, phenotypes, and imaging signals) with binary trait (disease status). In this paper, we will review algorithmic information theory as a general framework for causal discovery and the recent development of statistical methods for causal inference on discrete data, and discuss the possibility of extending the association analysis of discrete variable with disease to the causal analysis for discrete variable and disease.},

Among other personal information, some social media users communicate about mental health problems they are experiencing, with the intention of getting advice, support or empathy from other users. Here, we investigate the language of Reddit posts specific to mental health, to define linguistic characteristics that could be helpful for further applications. The latter include attempting to identify posts that need urgent attention due to their nature, e.g. when someone announces their intentions of ending their life by suicide or harming others. Our results show that there are a variety of linguistic features that are discriminative across mental health user communities and that can be further exploited in subsequent classification tasks. Furthermore , while negative sentiment is almost uniformly expressed across the entire data set, we demonstrate that there are also condition-specific vocabularies used in social media to communicate about particular disorders.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled the discovery of candidate markers that play significant roles in various complex traits in plants. Recently, with increased interest in the search for candidate markers, studies on epistatic interactions between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have also increased, thus enabling the identification of more candidate markers along with GWAS on single-variant-additive-effect. Here, we focused on the identification of candidate markers associated with flowering time in soybean (Glycine max). A large population of 2,662 cultivated soybean accessions was genotyped using the 180k Axiom® SoyaSNP array, and the genomic architecture of these accessions was investigated to confirm the population structure. Then, GWAS was conducted to evaluate the association between SNP markers and flowering time. A total of 93 significant SNP markers were detected within 59 significant genes, including E1 and E3, which are the main determinants of flowering time. Based on the GWAS results, multilocus epistatic interactions were examined between the significant and non-significant SNP markers. Two significant and 16 non-significant SNP markers were discovered as candidate markers affecting flowering time via interactions with each other. These 18 candidate SNP markers mapped to 18 candidate genes including E1 and E3, and the 18 candidate genes were involved in six major flowering pathways. Although further biological validation is needed, our results provide additional information on the existing flowering time markers and present another option to marker-assisted breeding programs for regulating flowering time of soybean.},

Whether this association reflects causal association is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the causal association of AF with Alzheimer disease.Methods and ResultsWe used a 2‐sample Mendelian randomization approach to evaluate the causal effect of AF on Alzheimer disease. Summary data on the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with AF were obtained from a recently published genome‐wide association study with up to 1 030 836 individuals and data on single nucleotide polymorphism‐Alzheimer disease association from another genome‐wide association study with up to 455 258 individuals. AF was mainly diagnosed according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9 or ICD‐10) and Alzheimer disease was mainly diagnosed according to clinical criteria (eg, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS‐ADRDA] criteria). Effect estimates were calculated using the inverse‐variance weighted method. The Mendelian randomization analysis showed nonsignificant association of genetically predicted AF with risk of Alzheimer disease (odds ratio=1.002, 95\% CI: 0.996–1.009, P=0.47) using 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms as the instruments. Mendelian randomization‐Egger indicated no evidence of genetic pleiotropy (intercept=0.0002, 95\% CI: −0.001 to 0.001, P=0.70).ConclusionsThis Mendelian randomization analysis found no evidence to support causal association between AF and Alzheimer disease.},

Here we introduce a pipeline to infer sleep onset, duration, and quality from raw accelerometer data and then quantify relationships between derived sleep metrics and other variables of interest. The pipeline released here for the deep phenotyping of sleep, as the DPSleep software package, uses (a) a stepwise algorithm to detect missing data; (b) within-individual, minute-based, spectral power percentiles of activity; and (c) iterative, forward- and backward-sliding windows to estimate the major Sleep Episode onset and offset. Software modules allow for manual quality control adjustment of derived sleep features and correction for time zone changes. In this report, we illustrate the pipeline with data from participants studied for more than 200 days each. Actigraphy-based measures of sleep duration are associated with self-report rating of sleep quality. Simultaneous measures of smartphone use and GPS location data support the validity of the sleep timing inferences and reveal how phone measures of sleep timing can differ from actigraphy data. We discuss the uses of DPSleep in relation to other available sleep estimation approaches and provide example use cases that include multi-dimensional, deep longitudinal phenotyping, extended measurement of dynamics associated with mental illness, and the possibility of combining wearable actigraphy and personal electronic device data (e.g., smartphone, tablet) to measure individual differences across a wide range of behavioral variation in health and disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal. Principal Findings To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed “Enrichment Map”, a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results. Conclusions Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).},

Their connectivity network needs to be considered for the full understanding of biological phenomena, but the available information on protein-protein associations is incomplete and exhibits varying levels of annotation granularity and reliability. The STRING database aims to collect, score and integrate all publicly available sources of protein-protein interaction information, and to complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself.

DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype-phenotype relationships. The information is accessible through a web interface, a Cytoscape App, an RDF SPARQL endpoint, scripts in several programming languages and an R package. DisGeNET is a versatile platform that can be used for different research purposes including the investigation of the molecular underpinnings of specific human diseases and their comorbidities, the analysis of the properties of disease genes, the generation of hypothesis on drug therapeutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation of computationally predicted disease genes and the evaluation of text-mining methods performance.},

However, extracting meaningful results from massive experimental data sets is a challenging task for biologists. Projecting data onto pathway and network contexts is a powerful way to unravel patterns embedded in seemingly scattered large data sets and assist knowledge discovery related to cancer and other complex diseases. We have developed a Cytoscape app called “ReactomeFIViz”, which utilizes a highly reliable gene functional interaction network combined with human curated pathways derived from Reactome and other pathway databases. This app provides a suite of features to assist biologists in performing pathway- and network-based data analysis in a biologically intuitive and user-friendly way. Biologists can use this app to uncover network and pathway patterns related to their studies, search for gene signatures from gene expression data sets, reveal pathways significantly enriched by genes in a list, and integrate multiple genomic data types into a pathway context using probabilistic graphical models. We believe our app will give researchers substantial power to analyze intrinsically noisy high-throughput experimental data to find biologically relevant information.},

	abstract = {This paper challenges the common assumption that some phenotypic traits are quantitative while others are qualitative. The distinction between these two kinds of traits is widely influential in biological and biomedical research as well as in scientific education and communication. This is probably due to both historical and epistemological reasons. However, the quantitative/qualitative distinction involves a variety of simplifications on the genetic causes of phenotypic variability and on the development of complex traits. Here, I examine three cases from the life sciences that show inconsistencies in the distinction: Mendelian traits (dwarfism and pigmentation in plant and animal models), Mendelian diseases (phenylketonuria), and polygenic mental disorders (schizophrenia). I show that these traits can be framed both quantitatively and qualitatively depending, for instance, on the methods through which they are investigated and on specific epistemic purposes (e.g., clinical diagnosis versus causal explanation). This suggests that the received view of quantitative and qualitative traits has a limited heuristic power—limited to some local contexts or to the specific methodologies adopted. Throughout the paper, I provide directions for framing phenotypes beyond the quantitative/qualitative distinction. I conclude by pointing at the necessity of developing a principled characterisation of what phenotypic traits, in general, are.},

Here, we introduce the Multivariate Omnibus Statistical Test (MOSTest), with an efficient computational design enabling rapid and reliable inference, and apply it to 171 regional brain morphology measures from 26,502 UK Biobank participants. At the conventional genome-wide significance threshold of α = 5 × 10−8, MOSTest identifies 347 genomic loci associated with regional brain morphology, more than any previous study, improving upon the discovery of established GWAS approaches more than threefold. Our findings implicate more than 5\% of all protein-coding genes and provide evidence for gene sets involved in neuron development and differentiation.},

Recent advances in neuroimaging and genomic databases of large healthy and diseased cohorts have empowered studies to characterize effects of the discovered genetic factors on brain structure and function, implicating neural pathways and genetic mechanisms in the underlying biology. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of the imaging and genomic data requires new advanced biomedical data science tools to manage, process and analyze the data. In this work, we introduce Neuroimaging PheWAS (phenome-wide association study): a web-based system for searching over a wide variety of brain-wide imaging phenotypes to discover true system-level gene-brain relationships using a unified genotype-to-phenotype strategy. This design features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for anonymous data uploading, study definition and management, and interactive result visualizations as well as a cloud-based computational infrastructure and multiple state-of-art methods for statistical association analysis and multiple comparison correction. We demonstrated the potential of Neuroimaging PheWAS with a case study analyzing the influences of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene on various brain morphological properties across the brain in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Benchmark tests were performed to evaluate the system’s performance using data from UK Biobank. The Neuroimaging PheWAS system is freely available. It simplifies the execution of PheWAS on neuroimaging data and provides an opportunity for imaging genetics studies to elucidate routes at play for specific genetic variants on diseases in the context of detailed imaging phenotypic data.},

We extend the interpretation of the Principle of Mendelian randomization (PMR) and present MRPC, a novel machine learning algorithm that incorporates the PMR in classical algorithms for learning causal graphs in computer science. MRPC learns a causal biological network efficiently and robustly from integrating genotype and molecular phenotype data, in which directed edges indicate causal directions. We demonstrate through simulation that MRPC outperforms existing general-purpose network inference methods and other PMR-based methods. We apply MRPC to distinguish direct and indirect targets among multiple genes associated with expression quantitative trait loci.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Osteoporosis is a common global health problem characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of fracture. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified {\textgreater}100 genetic loci associated with BMD. However, the functional genes responsible for most associations remain largely unknown. We conducted an innovative summary statistic data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis to identify novel causal genes associated with BMD and explored their potential functional significance.
METHODS: After quality control of the largest GWAS meta-analysis data of BMD and the largest expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) meta-analysis data from peripheral blood samples, 5967 genes were tested using the SMR method. Another eQTL data was used to verify the results. Next we performed a fine-mapping association analysis to investigate the functional SNP in the identified loci. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore functional relationships for the identified novel genes with known putative osteoporosis genes. Further, we assessed functions of the identified genes through in vitro cellular study or previous functional studies.
RESULTS: We identified two potentially causal genes (ASB16-AS1 and SYN2) associated with BMD. SYN2 was a novel osteoporosis candidate gene and ASB16-AS1 locus was known to be associated with BMD but was not the nearest gene to the top GWAS SNP. Fine-mapping association analysis showed that rs184478 and rs795000 was predicted to be possible causal SNPs in ASB16-AS1 and SYN2, respectively. ASB16-AS1 co-expressed with several known putative osteoporosis risk genes. In vitro cellular study showed that over-expressed ASB16-AS1 increased the expression of osteoblastogenesis related genes (BMP2 and ALPL), indicating its functional significance.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support that ASB16-AS1 and SYN2 may represent two novel functional genes underlying BMD variation. The findings provide a basis for further functional mechanistic studies.},

	abstract = {Plant developmental dynamics can be heritable, genetically correlated with fitness and yield, and undergo selection. Therefore, characterizing the mechanistic connections between the genetic architecture governing plant development and the resulting ontogenetic dynamics of plants in field settings is critically important for agricultural production and evolutionary ecology. We use hierarchical Bayesian Function-Valued Trait (FVT) models to estimate Brassica rapa growth curves throughout ontogeny, across two treatments, and in two growing seasons. We find genetic variation for plasticity of growth rates and final sizes, but not the inflection point (transition from accelerating to decelerating growth) of growth curves. There are trade-offs between growth rate and duration, indicating that selection for maximum yields at early harvest dates may come at the expense of late harvest yields and vice versa. We generate eigengene modules and determine which are co-expressed with FVT traits using a Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis. Independently, we seed a Mutual Rank co-expression network model with FVT traits to identify specific genes and gene networks related to FVT. GO-analyses of eigengene modules indicate roles for actin/cytoskeletal genes, herbivore resistance/wounding responses, and cell division, while MR networks demonstrate a close association between metabolic regulation and plant growth. We determine that combining FVT Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and MR genes/WGCNA eigengene expression profiles better characterizes phenotypic variation than any single data type (i.e. QTL, gene, or eigengene alone). Our network analysis allows us to employ a targeted eQTL analysis, which we use to identify regulatory hotspots for FVT. We examine cis vs. trans eQTL that mechanistically link FVT QTL with structural trait variation. Colocalization of FVT, gene, and eigengene eQTL provide strong evidence for candidate genes influencing plant height. The study is the first to explore eQTL for FVT, and specifically do so in agroecologically relevant field settings.},

	abstract = {Immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) arise when tolerance is lost and chronic inflammation is targeted towards healthy tissues. Despite their growing prevalence, therapies to treat IMDs are lacking. Cytokines and their receptors orchestrate inflammatory responses by regulating elaborate signalling networks across multiple cell types making it challenging to pinpoint therapeutically relevant drivers of IMDs. We developed an analytical framework that integrates Mendelian randomization (MR) and multiple-trait colocalization (moloc) analyses to highlight putative cell-specific drivers of IMDs. MR evaluated causal associations between the levels of 10 circulating cytokines and 9 IMDs within human populations. Subsequently, we undertook moloc analyses to assess whether IMD trait, cytokine protein and corresponding gene expression are driven by a shared causal variant. Moreover, we leveraged gene expression data from three separate cell types (monocytes, neutrophils and T cells) to discern whether associations may be attributed to cell type-specific drivers of disease. MR analyses supported a causal role for IL-18 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (P = 1.17 × 10−4) and eczema/dermatitis (P = 2.81 × 10−3), as well as associations between IL-2rα and IL-6R with several other IMDs. Moloc strengthened evidence of a causal association for these results, as well as providing evidence of a monocyte and neutrophil-driven role for IL-18 in IBD pathogenesis. In contrast, IL-2rα and IL-6R associations were found to be T cell specific. Our analytical pipeline can help to elucidate putative molecular pathways in the pathogeneses of IMDs, which could be applied to other disease contexts.},

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is a complex autoimmune disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Translation of Genome-Wide Association Study findings into therapeutics and effective preventive strategies has been limited to date. We used summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to synthesize findings from public expression quantitative trait locus, methylation quantitative trait locus and Multiple Sclerosis Genome-Wide Association Study datasets. By correlating the effects of methylation on multiple sclerosis, methylation on expression and expression on multiple sclerosis susceptibility, we prioritize genetic loci with evidence of influencing multiple sclerosis susceptibility. We overlay these findings onto a list of ‘druggable’ genes, i.e. genes which are currently, or could theoretically, be targeted by therapeutic compounds. We use GeNets and search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins to identify protein–protein interactions and druggable pathways enriched in our results. We extend these findings to a model of Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells, lymphoblastoid cell lines. We conducted a systematic review of prioritized genes using the Open Targets platform to identify completed and planned trials targeting prioritized genes in multiple sclerosis and related disease areas. Expression of 45 genes in peripheral blood was strongly associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility (False discovery rate 0.05). Of these 45 genes, 20 encode a protein which is currently targeted by an existing therapeutic compound. These genes were enriched for Gene Ontology terms pertaining to immune system function and leucocyte signalling. We refined this prioritized gene list by restricting to loci where CpG site methylation was associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility, with gene expression and where expression was associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility. This approach yielded a list of 15 prioritized druggable target genes for which there was evidence of a pathway linking methylation, expression and multiple sclerosis. Five of these 15 genes are targeted by existing drugs and three were replicated in a smaller expression Quantitative Trait Loci dataset (CD40, MERTK and PARP1). In lymphoblastoid cell lines, this approach prioritized 7 druggable gene targets, of which only one was prioritized by the multi-omic approach in peripheral blood (FCRL3). Systematic review of Open Targets revealed multiple early-phase trials targeting 13/20 prioritized genes in disorders related to multiple sclerosis. We use public datasets and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to identify a list of prioritized druggable genetic targets in multiple sclerosis. We hope our findings could be translated into a platform for developing targeted preventive therapies.},

Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene–trait associations, 36\% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy.

	abstract = {A conventional Mendelian randomization analysis assesses the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome by using genetic variants that are solely associated with the risk factor of interest as instrumental variables. However, in some cases, such as the case of triglyceride level as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it may be difficult to find a relevant genetic variant that is not also associated with related risk factors, such as other lipid fractions. Such a variant is known as pleiotropic. In this paper, we propose an extension of Mendelian randomization that uses multiple genetic variants associated with several measured risk factors to simultaneously estimate the causal effect of each of the risk factors on the outcome. This “multivariable Mendelian randomization” approach is similar to the simultaneous assessment of several treatments in a factorial randomized trial. In this paper, methods for estimating the causal effects are presented and compared using real and simulated data, and the assumptions necessary for a valid multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis are discussed. Subject to these assumptions, we demonstrate that triglyceride-related pathways have a causal effect on the risk of coronary heart disease independent of the effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.},

	abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure?outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

	abstract = {Sarcopenia is a complex polygenic disease, and its molecular mechanism is still unclear. Whole lean body mass (WLBM) is a heritable trait predicting sarcopenia. To identify genomic loci underlying, we performed a whole-exome sequencing (WES) of WLBM variation with high sequencing depth (more than 40*) in 101 Chinese subjects. We then replicated in the major findings in the large-scale UK Biobank (UKB) cohort (N = 217,822) for WLBM. The results of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significant both in the discovery stage and replication stage: SNP rs740681 (discovery p = 1.66 × 10–6, replication p = .05), rs2272303 (discovery p = 3.20 × 10–4, replication p = 3.10 × 10–4), rs11170413 (discovery p = 3.99 × 10–4, replication p = 2.90 × 10–4), and rs2272302 (discovery p = 9.13 × 10–4, replication p = 3.10 × 10–4). We combined p values of the significant SNPs. Functional annotations highlighted two candidate genes, including FZR1 and SOAT2, that may exert pleiotropic effects to the development of body mass. Our findings provide useful insights that further enhance our understanding of genetic interplay in sarcopenia.},

	abstract = {In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus control endogenous circadian rhythms and entrainment to the environment. A core SCN region of calbindin (CalB)-containing cells is retinorecipient and the cells therein lack rhythmic expression of clock genes and electrical activity. The core is surrounded by a ‘shell’ of rhythmic oscillator cells. In the present experiments, we studied the spatial arrangement of oscillator cells by examining the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of the canonical clock genes Per1, Per2 and vasopressin mRNA, a clock-controlled gene. Surprisingly, in the SCN shell, the dorsomedial cells were the first to rhythmically express both Per1 and VP mRNA, with gene expression then spreading very slowly through much of the nucleus for the next 12 h then receding to baseline levels. Following a light pulse, Per expression increased after 1 h in the core SCN and after 1.5 h in the shell. Although expression in the shell occurred earlier in light-pulsed animals than in those housed in constant darkness, it still followed the same spatial and temporal expression pattern as was observed in constant darkness. The results suggest that not only is the SCN organized into light-responsive and rhythmic regions but also that the rhythmic region of the SCN itself has an ordered arrangement of SCN oscillator cells.},

	abstract = {To accommodate daily recurring environmental changes, animals show cyclic variations in behaviour and physiology, which include prominent behavioural states such as sleep–wake cycles but also a host of less conspicuous oscillations in neurological, metabolic, endocrine, cardiovascular and immune functions. Circadian rhythmicity is created endogenously by genetically encoded molecular clocks, whose components cooperate to generate cyclic changes in their own abundance and activity, with a periodicity of about a day. Throughout the body, such molecular clocks convey temporal control to the function of organs and tissues by regulating pertinent downstream programmes. Synchrony between the different circadian oscillators and resonance with the solar day is largely enabled by a neural pacemaker, which is directly responsive to certain environmental cues and able to transmit internal time-of-day representations to the entire body. In this Review, we discuss aspects of the circadian clock in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals, including the components of these molecular oscillators, the function and mechanisms of action of central and peripheral clocks, their synchronization and their relevance to human health.},

	abstract = {To reveal brain regions and transmitter systems involved in control of pancreatic hormone secretion, specific vagal and sympathetic denervation were combined with injection of a retrograde transsynaptic tracer, pseudorabies virus (PRV), into the pancreas. After sympathetic or vagal transsection first-order neurons were revealed in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) or in preganglionic spinal cord neurons (SPN), respectively. Careful timing of the survival of the animals allowed the detection of cell groups in immediate control of these DMV or SPN neurons. A far larger number of cell groups is involved in the control of DMV than of SPN neurons. Examples are given of a high level of interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Several cell groups project to both branches of the autonomic nervous system, sometimes even the same neurotransmitter is used, e.g., oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and melanin-concentrating hormone and orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus project to both the DMV and SPN neurons. Moreover, the appearance of third-order neurons located in the sympathetic SPN after complete sympathectomy and in the DMV after complete vagotomy illustrates the possibility that motor neurons of the sympathetic and parasympathetic system may exchange information by means of interneurons. The presence of second-order neurons in prefrontal, gustatory, and piriform cortex may provide an anatomic basis for the involvement of these cortices in the cephalic insulin response. The observation that second-order neurons in both vagal and sympathetic control of the pancreas contain neuropeptides that are known to play a role in food intake indicates a direct association between behavioral and autonomic functions. Finally, the observation of third-order neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus shows the modulatory action of the time of the day and metabolic state, respectively.},

	abstract = {In mammals, endogenous circadian clocks sense and respond to daily feeding and lighting cues, adjusting internal ∼24 h rhythms to resonate with, and anticipate, external cycles of day and night. The mechanism underlying circadian entrainment to feeding time is critical for understanding why mistimed feeding, as occurs during shift work, disrupts circadian physiology, a state that is associated with increased incidence of chronic diseases such as type 2 (T2) diabetes. We show that feeding-regulated hormones insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) reset circadian clocks in vivo and in vitro by induction of PERIOD proteins, and mistimed insulin signaling disrupts circadian organization of mouse behavior and clock gene expression. Insulin and IGF-1 receptor signaling is sufficient to determine essential circadian parameters, principally via increased PERIOD protein synthesis. This requires coincident mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, increased phosphoinositide signaling, and microRNA downregulation. Besides its well-known homeostatic functions, we propose insulin and IGF-1 are primary signals of feeding time to cellular clocks throughout the body.},

In mammals, a master clock residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is reset by the light-dark cycle, while timed food intake is a potent synchronizer of peripheral clocks such as the liver. Alterations in food intake rhythms can uncouple peripheral clocks from the SCN, resulting in internal desynchrony, which promotes obesity and metabolic disorders. Pancreas-derived hormones such as insulin and glucagon have been implicated in signaling mealtime to peripheral clocks. In this study, we identify a novel, more direct pathway of food-driven liver clock resetting involving oxyntomodulin (OXM). In mice, food intake stimulates OXM secretion from the gut, which resets liver transcription rhythms via induction of the core clock genes Per1 and 2. Inhibition of OXM signaling blocks food-mediated resetting of hepatocyte clocks. These data reveal a direct link between gastric filling with food and circadian rhythm phasing in metabolic tissues.},

	abstract = {Intermittent fasting (IF) has been gaining popularity as a means of losing weight. The Ramadan fast (RF) is a form of IF practiced by millions of adult Muslims globally for a whole lunar month every year. It entails a major shift from normal eating patterns to exclusive nocturnal eating. RF is a state of intermittent liver glycogen depletion and repletion. The earlier (morning) part of the fasting day is marked by dominance of carbohydrate as the main fuel, but lipid becomes more important towards the afternoon and as the time for breaking the fast at sunset (iftar) gets closer. The practice of observing Ramadan fasting is accompanied by changes in sleeping and activity patterns, as well as circadian rhythms of hormones including cortisol, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, growth hormone, prolactin, sex hormones, and adiponectin. Few studies have investigated energy expenditure in the context of RF including resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total energy expenditure (TEE) and found no significant changes with RF. Changes in activity and sleeping patterns however do occur and are different from non-Ramadan days. Weight changes in the context of Ramadan fast are variable and typically modest with wise inter-individual variation. As well as its direct relevance to many religious observers, understanding intermittent fasting may have implications on weight loss strategies with even broader potential implications. This review examines current knowledge on different aspects of energy balance in RF, as a common model to learn from and also map out strategies for healthier outcomes in such settings.},

Evidence review: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar by 2020 April for publications on IF or TRF and their mechanisms. Studies include animal models and human cohorts.
Findings: One important mechanism is that IF allows certain period of fasting time, in which our bodies activate pathways of repair and rejuvenation. Moreover, the advantages of IF, especially TRF over total caloric restriction (CR) provided bases for various animal and human studies which suggested that the feeding-fasting rhythm stimulates the fluctuation of our gut microbiota and a series of subsequent molecular alterations, which in turn restored a healthier circadian clock that resembled our inherent clock formed throughout millions of years of homo sapiens history.
Conclusions and Relevance for Reviews: Complete understanding of the mechanism leading to the beneficial effects of IF paves the way for tailored dietary regimen to combat a wide range of diseases and ill health conditions.},

As the largest metabolic organ, the liver sensitively responds to the food signals and secretes hepatokines, leading to the robust regulation of metabolic and clock processes. However, it remains unknown which hepatokine mediates the food-driven resetting of the liver clock independent of the master clock. Here, we identify Angptl8 as a hepatokine that resets diurnal rhythms of hepatic clock and metabolic genes in mice. Mechanistically, the resetting function of Angptl8 is dependent on the signal relay of the membrane receptor PirB, phosphorylation of kinases and transcriptional factors, and consequently transient activation of the central clock gene Per1. Importantly, inhibition of Angptl8 signaling partially blocks food-entrained resetting of liver clock in mice. We have thus identified Angptl8 as a key regulator of the liver clock in response to food.},

However, recent work has demonstrated that the SCN and peripheral tissues generate independent circadian oscillations in Per1 clock gene expression in vitro. In the present study, we sought to clarify the role of the SCN in the intact system by recording rhythms in clock gene expression in vivo. A practical imaging protocol was developed that enables us to measure circadian rhythms easily, noninvasively, and longitudinally in individual mice. Circadian oscillations were detected in the kidney, liver, and submandibular gland studied in about half of the SCN-lesioned, behaviorally arrhythmic mice. However, their amplitude was decreased in these organs. Free-running periods of peripheral clocks were identical to those of activity rhythms recorded before the SCN lesion. Thus, we can report for the first time that many of the fundamental properties of circadian oscillations in peripheral clocks in vivo are maintained in the absence of SCN control.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The circadian rhythm of about 24 hours is a fundamental physiological function observed in almost all organisms from prokaryotes to humans. Identification of clock genes has allowed us to study the molecular bases for circadian behaviors and temporal physiological processes such as hormonal secretion, and has prompted the idea that molecular clocks reside not only in a central pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of hypothalamus in mammals, but also in peripheral tissues, even in immortalized cells. Furthermore, previous molecular dissection revealed that the mechanism of circadian oscillation at a molecular level is based on transcriptional regulation of clock and clock-controlled genes.
RESULTS: We systematically analyzed the mRNA expression of clock and clock-controlled genes in mouse peripheral tissues. Eight genes (mBmal1, mNpas2, mRev-erbalpha, mDbp, mRev-erbbeta, mPer3, mPer1 and mPer2; given in the temporal order of the rhythm peak) showed robust circadian expressions of mRNAs in all tissues except testis, suggesting that these genes are core molecules of the molecular biological clock. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that these genes have one or a combination of 3 transcriptional elements (RORE, DBPE, and E-box), which are conserved among human, mouse, and rat genome sequences, and indicated that these 3 elements may be responsible for the biological timing of expression of canonical clock genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The observation of oscillatory profiles of canonical clock genes is not only useful for physiological and pathological examination of the circadian clock in various organs but also important for systematic understanding of transcriptional regulation on a genome-wide basis. Our finding of the oscillatory expression of canonical clock genes with a temporal order provides us an interesting hypothesis, that cyclic timing of all clock and clock-controlled genes may be dependent on several transcriptional elements including 3 known elements, E-box, RORE, and DBPE.},

	abstract = {1.In thefirst part of the paper, the model of non-parametric entrainment of circadian pacemakers is tested for the case of nocturnal rodents. The model makes use of the available data on freerunning period (τ) in constant darkness (Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976a) and on phase response curves (PRC) for short light pulses (Daan and Pittendrigh, 1976a). It is tested in experiments using 1 or 2 light pulses per cycle.2.Mesocricetus auratus andPeromyscus leucopus entrain to Zeitgebers involving 1 pulse (15′ or 60′) per cycle. The phase angle differences between rhythm and light cycle depends on the periods (τ andT) as predicted by the model. Entrainment ofP. leucopus is unstable due to the after effects on τ created by the light pulse.3.The limiting values of zeitgeber period to which the animals entrain are much closer to 24 h than inDrosophila pseudoobscura, as the model predicts. However, frequent failures to entrain toT=23 andT=25 h are only explained if we take considerable interindividual variation in both τ and PRC into account.4.With 2 pulses per cycle, the model predicts that entrainment will be more stable when activity is in the longer interval between the pulses than when it is in the shorter interval. This is true in the experimental data, where the phase relationships match predictions for skeleton photoperiods up to ca. 14 h. Increasing asymmetry forces animals into a “phase jump”, so that activity shifts from the shorter to the longer interval. Theseψ-jumps are accurately predicted in the hamster, but they occur at much longer photoperiods than predicted inP. leucopus.5.Thus, the unqualified model, using a rigidly fixed species τ and PRC, is surely inadequate to explain entrainment. The extent to which variations in τ and PRC-shape, both “spontaneous” and induced by the entrainment process, can be known or inferred restricts the validity of the predictions. Yet we conclude, from a good deal of agreement between experiment and prediction (i), from the close correspondence between complete and skeleton photoperiods (ii), and on behavioural grounds (iii), that non-parametric entrainment by short light signals has a major share in the entrainment of nocturnal rodent rhythms in nature.6.With these restrictions in mind, we analyse in thesecond part of the paper how the empirical regularities concerning τ and PRC, and reported earlier (Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976; Daan and Pittendrigh, 1976a, b), contribute to the stabilization of the phase angle difference (ψ) between the pacemaker and the external world. Use is made of computer simulations of artificial pacemakers with variable τ and PRC.7.ψ is most sensitive to instabilities in τ when\$\${\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}tau \$\$is close to 24 h. Thus the verycircadian nature of these pacemakers helps to conserveψ. Selection pressure for homeostasis ofτ has been large in a species (M. auratus) where\$\${\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}tau \$\$=24 h. The effect ofψ-instability is further reduced by entrainment with 2 pulses (dawn and dusk), made possible by the PRC's having both an advance and a delay section.8.To analyze the contributions toψ-conservation with seasonally changing photoperiod, we have assumed that it is of functional significance to conserve the phase of activity with respect to dusk (nocturnal animals) or to dawn (diurnal animals). We distinguish three contributions of nocturnal pacemaker behaviour to this type ofψ-conservation: increased amplitude of the PRC (i), asymmetry in the PRC, such that the slope of the delay-part is steeper than the slope of the advance-part (ii), and a short freerunning period in DD (iii).9.A further contribution must derive from parametric effects of light, which are not traceable by the model, but certainly effective in preventing in complete photoperiods theψ-jump which is seen in skeleton photoperiods. The existence of parametric effects is further demonstrated by the change of τ with light intensity in LL, described by Aschoff's Rule, which presumably reflects differences in PRC-shape between nocturnal and diurnal animals (Daan and Pittendrigh, 1976b).10.The paper concludes with an attempt to distinguish the features of circadian clocks that are analytically necessary for entrainment to occur (i), or have functional meaning, either in the measurement of the lapse of time (ii) or in the identification of local time (iii).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-amplitude temperature oscillations can entrain the phase of circadian rhythms in several unicellular and multicellular organisms, including Neurospora and Drosophila. Because mammalian body temperature is subject to circadian variations of 1 degrees C-4 degrees C, we wished to determine whether these temperature cycles could serve as a Zeitgeber for circadian gene expression in peripheral cell types.
RESULTS: In RAT1 fibroblasts cultured in vitro, circadian gene expression could be established by a square wave temperature rhythm with a (Delta)T of 4 degrees C (12 hr 37 degrees C/12 hr 33 degrees C). To examine whether natural body temperature rhythms can also affect circadian gene expression, we first measured core body temperature cycles in the peritoneal cavities of mice by radiotelemetry. We then reproduced these rhythms with high precision in the liquid medium of cultured fibroblasts for several days by means of a homemade computer-driven incubator. While these "in vivo" temperature rhythms were incapable of establishing circadian gene expression de novo, they could maintain previously induced rhythms for multiple days; by contrast, the rhythms of control cells kept at constant temperature rapidly dampened. Moreover, circadian oscillations of environmental temperature could reentrain circadian clocks in the livers of mice, probably via the changes they imposed upon both body temperature and feeding behavior. Interestingly, these changes in ambient temperature did not affect the phase of the central circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.
CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that both endogenous and environmental temperature cycles can participate in the synchronization of peripheral clocks in mammals.},

It is believed that the SCN clock entrains the phase of peripheral clocks via chemical cues, such as rhythmically secreted hormones. Here we show that temporal feeding restriction under light-dark or dark-dark conditions can change the phase of circadian gene expression in peripheral cell types by up to 12 h while leaving the phase of cyclic gene expression in the SCN unaffected. Hence, changes in metabolism can lead to an uncoupling of peripheral oscillators from the central pacemaker. Sudden large changes in feeding time, similar to abrupt changes in the photoperiod, reset the phase of rhythmic gene expression gradually and are thus likely to act through a clock-dependent mechanism. Food-induced phase resetting proceeds faster in liver than in kidney, heart, or pancreas, but after 1 wk of daytime feeding, the phases of circadian gene expression are similar in all examined peripheral tissues.},

By early 2009, GWAS on 47 samples of subjects with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia will be completed. Taken together, these GWAS constitute the largest biological experiment ever conducted in psychiatry (59 000 independent cases and controls, 7700 family trios and {\textgreater}40 billion genotypes). We know that GWAS can work, and the question now is whether it will work for psychiatric disorders. In this review, we describe these studies, the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium for meta-analyses of these data, and provide a logical framework for interpretation of some of the conceivable outcomes.},

There are no objective biological phenotypes for these disorders, which are characterized by complex genetics and prominent roles for gene-environment interactions. The study of the neurobiology underlying these severe psychiatric disorders has been hindered by the lack of access to the tissue of interest - neurons from patients. The advent of reprogramming methods that enable generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patient fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells has opened possibilities for new approaches to study relevant disease biology using iPSC-derived neurons. While early studies with patient iPSCs have led to promising and intriguing leads, significant hurdles remain in our attempts to capture the complexity of these disorders in vitro. We present here an overview of studies to date of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using iPSC-derived neuronal cells and discuss potential future directions that can result in the identification of robust and valid cellular phenotypes that in turn can lay the groundwork for meaningful clinical advances.},

No human genetic findings have completely driven drug development for inflammatory arthritis; however, genetic associations have partly driven the development of abatacept (CTLA-4-Ig) in rheumatoid arthritis and secukinumab (anti-IL-23R) in ankylosing spondylitis. Roadblocks to progress exist, including little knowledge of the genetic architecture and regulatory mechanisms underlying associations, and the need to identify gene regulatory networks and assess target tractability. New opportunities are arising that could maximise the informativeness of GWAS for drug target validation. Genetic variants can be linked to core genes by using functional genomics and then to peripheral genes interconnected to core genes using network information. Moreover, identification of crosstalk between biological pathways might highlight key points for therapeutic intervention.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sample size calculations are an important tool for planning epidemiological studies. Large sample sizes are often required in Mendelian randomization investigations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Resources are provided for investigators to perform sample size and power calculations for Mendelian randomization with a binary outcome. We initially provide formulae for the continuous outcome case, and then analogous formulae for the binary outcome case. The formulae are valid for a single instrumental variable, which may be a single genetic variant or an allele score comprising multiple variants. Graphs are provided to give the required sample size for 80\% power for given values of the causal effect of the risk factor on the outcome and of the squared correlation between the risk factor and instrumental variable. R code and an online calculator tool are made available for calculating the sample size needed for a chosen power level given these parameters, as well as the power given the chosen sample size and these parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The sample size required for a given power of Mendelian randomization investigation depends greatly on the proportion of variance in the risk factor explained by the instrumental variable. The inclusion of multiple variants into an allele score to explain more of the variance in the risk factor will improve power, however care must be taken not to introduce bias by the inclusion of invalid variants.},

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate whether the association between subjective wellbeing (subjective happiness and life satisfaction) and cardiometabolic health is causal.
Design Two sample, bidirectional mendelian randomisation study.
Setting Genetic data taken from various cohorts comprised of the general population (mostly individuals of European ancestry, plus a small proportion of other ancestries); follow-up analysis included individuals from the United Kingdom.
Participants Summary data were used from previous genome wide association studies (number of participants ranging from 83 198 to 339 224), which investigated traits related to cardiovascular or metabolic health, had the largest sample sizes, and consisted of the most similar populations while minimising sample overlap. A follow-up analysis included 337 112 individuals from the UK Biobank (54\% female (n=181 363), mean age 56.87 years (standard deviation 8.00) at recruitment).
Main outcome measures Subjective wellbeing and 11 measures of cardiometabolic health (coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction; total, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol; diastolic and systolic blood pressure; body fat; waist to hip ratio; waist circumference; and body mass index).
Results Evidence of a causal effect of body mass index on subjective wellbeing was seen; each 1 kg/m2 increase in body mass index caused a −0.045 (95\% confidence interval −0.084 to −0.006, P=0.02) standard deviation reduction in subjective wellbeing. Follow-up analysis of this association in an independent sample from the UK Biobank provided strong evidence of an effect of body mass index on satisfaction with health (β=−0.035 unit decrease in health satisfaction (95\% confidence interval −0.043 to −0.027) per standard deviation increase in body mass index, P{\textless}0.001). No clear evidence of a causal effect was seen between subjective wellbeing and the other cardiometabolic health measures, in either direction.
Conclusions These results suggest that a higher body mass index is associated with a lower subjective wellbeing. A follow-up analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting that the effect in middle aged people could be driven by satisfaction with health. Body mass index is a modifiable determinant, and therefore, this study provides further motivation to tackle the obesity epidemic because of the knock-on effects of higher body mass index on subjective wellbeing.},

We performed a MR phenome-wide association study (MR-pheWAS) to search for the causal effects of BMI in UK Biobank (n = 334 968), using the PHESANT open-source phenome scan tool. A subset of identified associations were followed up with a formal two-stage instrumental variable analysis in UK Biobank, to estimate the causal effect of BMI on these phenotypes. Of the 22 922 tests performed, our MR-pheWAS identified 587 associations below a stringent P value threshold corresponding to a 5\% estimated false discovery rate. These included many previously identified causal effects, for instance, an adverse effect of higher BMI on risk of diabetes and hypertension. We also identified several novel effects, including protective effects of higher BMI on a set of psychosocial traits, identified initially in our preliminary MR-pheWAS in circa 115,000 UK Biobank participants and replicated in a different subset of circa 223,000 UK Biobank participants. Our comprehensive MR-pheWAS identified potential causal effects of BMI on a large and diverse set of phenotypes. This included both previously identified causal effects, and novel effects such as a protective effect of higher BMI on feelings of nervousness.},

In the past decade, hundreds of genes have been identified that contribute to the serious deficits in communication, social cognition, and behavior that patients often experience. However, these only account for 10-20\% of ASD cases, and patients with similar pathogenic variants may be diagnosed on very different levels of the spectrum. In this review, we will describe the genetic landscape of ASD and discuss how genetic modifiers such as copy number variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and epigenetic alterations likely play a key role in modulating the phenotypic spectrum of ASD patients. We also consider how genetic modifiers can alter convergent signaling pathways and lead to impaired neural circuitry formation. Lastly, we review sex-linked modifiers and clinical implications. Further understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for both comprehending ASD and for developing novel therapies.},

Here we show that genome-wide SNP-heritability can be accurately estimated from biobank-scale data irrespective of genetic architecture, without specifying a heritability model or partitioning SNPs by allele frequency and/or LD. We show analytically and through extensive simulations starting from real genotypes (UK Biobank, N = 337 K) that, unlike existing methods, our closed-form estimator is robust across a wide range of architectures. We provide estimates of SNP-heritability for 22 complex traits in the UK Biobank and show that, consistent with our results in simulations, existing biobank-scale methods yield estimates up to 30\% different from our theoretically-justified approach.},

For each section, a discussion of how the different definitions and methodologies influence heritability estimates is provided. The general limitations of heritability studies are discussed including the issue of “missing heritability” in which heritability estimates are significantly higher than the variance explained by known genetic variants. Potential causes of missing heritability include restriction of many genetic association studies to single nucleotide polymorphisms, gene by gene interactions, epigenetics, and gene by environment interactions. Innovative strategies of accounting for missing heritability including modeling techniques and improved software are discussed.},

They regulate a variety of physiological and behavioral processes such as the sleep-wake rhythm. ASD is often associated with sleep disorders and low levels of melatonin. This first point raises the hypothesis that circadian rhythms could have an implication in ASD etiology. Moreover, circadian rhythms are generated by auto-regulatory genetic feedback loops, driven by transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, who drive transcription daily patterns of a wide number of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in different cellular contexts across tissues.

	abstract = {At the core of human thought, for the majority of individuals in the developed nations at least, there is the tacit assumption that as a species we are unfettered by the demands imposed by our biology and that we can do what we want, at whatever time we choose, whereas in reality every aspect of our physiology and behaviour is constrained by a 24 h beat arising from deep within our evolution. Our daily circadian rhythms and sleep/wake cycle allow us to function optimally in a dynamic world, adjusting our biology to the demands imposed by the day/night cycle. The themes developed in this review focus upon the growing realization that we ignore the circadian and sleep systems at our peril, and this paper considers the mechanisms that generate and regulate circadian and sleep systems; what happens mechanistically when these systems collapse as a result of societal pressures and disease; how sleep disruption and stress are linked; why sleep disruption and mental illness invariably occur together; and how individuals and employers can attempt to mitigate some of the problems associated with working against our internal temporal biology. While some of the health costs of sleep disruption can be reduced, in the short-term at least, there will always be significant negative consequences associated with shift work and sleep loss. With this in mind, society needs to address this issue and decide when the consequences of sleep disruption are justified in the workplace.},

Interventions altering light exposure patterns of affected individuals are a promising non-pharmacological treatment option, shown by previous meta-analyses to improve sleep, and often described as minimally invasive. To best translate laboratory-based mechanistic research into effective treatments, acceptability and barriers to adherence should be understood, but these have not yet been systematically evaluated. Here, we examined evidence regarding adherence and acceptability in studies of light or dark interventions using various delivery devices and protocols to improve sleep in intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders and neuropsychiatric illness. Attrition during intervention was low, and reported experiences were largely positive, but measurement and reporting of self-reported experiences, expectations, and adverse effects were poor. Approaches to management and measurement of adherence were varied, and available light monitoring technology appeared under-exploited, as did mobile technology to prompt or track adherence. Based on these findings we suggest recommended reporting items on acceptability and adherence for future investigations. Few studies assessed baseline light exposure patterns, and few personalised interventions. Overall, many applied studies exhibited an approach to light schedule interventions still reminiscent of laboratory protocols; this is unlikely to maximise acceptability and clinical effectiveness. For the next phase of translational research, user acceptability and adherence should receive increased attention during intervention design and study design. We suggest framing light therapies as complex interventions, and emphasise the occupationally embedded (daily activity routine embedded) context in which they occur.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are internal manifestations of the solar day that permit adaptations to predictable environmental temporal changes. These {\textasciitilde}24-h rhythms are controlled by molecular clockworks within the brain that are reset daily to precisely 24 h by exposure to the light-dark cycle. Information from the master clock in the mammalian hypothalamus conveys temporal information to the entire body via humoral and neural communication. A bidirectional relationship exists between mood disorders and circadian rhythms. Mood disorders are often associated with disrupted circadian clock-controlled responses, such as sleep and cortisol secretion, whereas disruption of circadian rhythms via jet lag, night-shift work, or exposure to artificial light at night, can precipitate or exacerbate affective symptoms in susceptible individuals. Evidence suggests strong associations between circadian rhythms and mental health, but only recently have studies begun to discover the direct interactions between the circadian system and mood regulation. This review provides an overview of disrupted circadian rhythms and the relationship to behavioral health and psychiatry. The focus of this review is delineating the role of disruption of circadian rhythms on mood disorders using human night shift studies, as well as jet lag studies to identify links. We also review animal models of disrupted circadian rhythms on affective responses. Lastly, we propose low-cost behavioral and lifestyle changes to improve circadian rhythms and presumably behavioral health.},

Reflecting this complicated history, there has been continual refinement from DSM-III with ‘Infantile Autism’ to the current DSM-V diagnosis. The disorder is now widely accepted as a complex, pervasive, heterogeneous condition with multiple etiologies, sub-types, and developmental trajectories. Diagnosis remains based on observation of atypical behaviors, with criteria of persistent deficits in social communication and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. This review provides a broad overview of the history, prevalence, etiology, clinical presentation, and heterogeneity of ASD. Factors contributing to heterogeneity, including genetic variability, comorbidity, and gender are reviewed. We then explore current evidence-based pharmacological and behavioral treatments for ASD and highlight the complexities of conducting clinical trials that evaluate therapeutic efficacy in ASD populations.

In view of an increasing number of people working at unusual times and linked health and safety risks, the wide range in human chronotypes may provide opportunities to allow people to work (and sleep) at times that are in synch with their circadian physiology. We aimed at estimating the distribution of chronotypes in the US population by age and sex. Twelve years (2003–2014) of pooled diary data from the American Time Use Survey were used to calculate chronotype based on mid-point of sleep on weekends (MSFWe, n = 53,689). We observed a near-normal distribution overall and within each age group. The distribution’s mean value is systematically different with age, shifting later during adolescence, showing a peak in ‘lateness’ at {\textasciitilde}19 years, and shifting earlier thereafter. Men are typically later chronotypes than women before 40, but earlier types after 40. The greatest differences are observed between 15 and 25 for both sexes, equaling more than 50\% of the total chronotype difference across all age groups. The variability in chronotype decreases with age, but is generally higher in males than females. This is the first study to estimate the distribution and prevalence of individual chronotypes in the US population based on a large-scale, nationally representative sample. Our finding that adolescents are on average the latest chronotypes supports delaying school start times to benefit their sleep and circadian alignment. The generally wide range in chronotypes may provide opportunities for tailored work schedules by matching external and internal time, potentially decreasing long- and short-term health and safety risks.},

	abstract = {Asperger syndrome (AS) was first described by Hans Asperger in 1944, as the behavioral characterization of individuals who have difficulties in communication and social interaction.[1] Since then, AS has always been a topic of significant interest and debate. Although AS was introduced as a discrete diagnostic category in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-4, 1994), almost 20 years later, its diagnostic label was removed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5), and it was encompassed in a more general category of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).[2] According to the DSM-5, there are varying degrees of ASD that are categorized based on the severity of symptoms and the required levels of support, and what was formerly called Asperger syndrome shall now be regarded as ASD.[3] Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include a group of neurodevelopmental abnormalities with broadly varying degrees and manifestations, usually begin in early childhood, and characterized by problems in social communication and interaction, along with behavioral problems such as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors.[4][5] DSM-5 changes on ASD classification led to some controversy about the loss of the unique Asperger identity,[6] and literature continue to debate about AS and its formulation within ASD.[7] Due to Asperger syndrome's extensive history, rich semiology, and relatively characteristic clinical presentations, specialists continue to use this diagnosis as a subtype of ASD with no language delay and a normal or superior IQ.[6] In this topic review, we will describe the essential aspects of autism spectrum disorder and Asperger syndrome. For greater transparency, we refer to (1) Asperger syndrome (AS) as a subpopulation of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) according to DSM-IV-TR, (2) ASD according to DSM-5, and (3) Autism spectrum disorder of an Asperger syndrome type (ASD-AS) as a subpopulation that is included in the DSM-5 as ASD of level 1 severity without intellectual impairment. Historical Perspective In 1944, and about a year after Leo Kanner described infantile autism, Hans Asperger introduced autistic psychopathy in the form of a case report. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognized autism as a distinct category in the DSM-3 and introduced it as infantile autism. In 1981, Wing L. restarted Asperger researches and renamed autistic psychopathy as Asperger syndrome. A few years later and in 1989, the first diagnostic criteria for AS was proposed,[7] and the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) was the first major classification system that recognized AS (1993). Finally, in 1994, AS was introduced in DSM-4 as a specific entity along with autistic disorder, within pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). While during this period, researches were focused on the development of measures with the ability to diagnose AS and differentiate it from high functioning autism (HFA), the DSM-5 removed the diagnostic category of AS in 2013.[5] The World Health Organization (WHO) also followed a similar approach in ICD-11, which will come into effect in 2022.[2] DSM Classification The systematic description of psychiatric disorders is quite complicated, particularly in child and adolescent psychiatry. Asperger syndrome was included in the DSM-IV-TR in the large family of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). PDD had five subtypes: Autistic disorder. Asperger syndrome. Childhood disintegrative disorder. Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Rett syndrome. Symptoms and clinical specifiers for autistic disorder of PDD were described to fall into three broad categories in DSM IV-TR: (1) social interaction, (2) communication, and (3) restricted, repetitive behavior.[8] The diagnosis of AS required:[7]: At least two symptoms of social interaction impairment and at least one each from symptoms of communication and restricted, repetitive behavior (RRB). Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the areas of (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (2) symbolic or imaginative play with onset prior to age 3 years. Diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder (or another specific PDD) should not be met (otherwise, the AS diagnosis is excluded, and autistic disorder diagnosis should have precedence). AS contrasted from autistic disorder in:[9]: Absence of diagnostic criteria in the communication domain. Absence of a requirement for onset before age 3. Addition of criteria specifying the absence of a language delay. Addition of criteria specifying the absence of a deficit in cognitive development. This classification suggested a differential diagnosis between AS and the type of Autistic disorder associated with normal cognitive functioning, also known as high functioning autism (HFA). As a result, it sparked substantial debate over uncertainty in defining AS criteria and the clinical overlap between AS and HFA, which has appeared in literature with contradictory results. Although there has been a considerable number of researches showing some fine differences between the two disorders, most studies have emphasized the meaningful similarities between AS and HFA.  Ultimately, the DSM-5 removed PDD and its categorization and merged four of its subtypes into one unifying category with the concept of a continuum named autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). This major alteration was mostly due to the assumption that PDD subgroups cannot be differentiated from one another certainly and reliably.[7] These changes include the following:[2][8] Another major alteration was the inclusion of social communication and social interaction related deficits in one criterion and exclusion of deficit specifically related to spoken language. Elimination of PDD and its subtypes. Creation of a new diagnostic category called autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), encompassing autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and PDD-NOS. Addition of three levels of severity, and clinical specifiers about the presence of cognitive and language impairment, to better characterize the diagnosis. Changing from previous PDD 3-domain criteria to ASD 2-domain criteria, composed of impaired social communication/interaction and restricted, repetitive behavior, interest, and activities (merging domains of social interaction and communication). Addition of sensory symptoms in the RRB component of diagnostic criteria. Changing the specification of the age of onset from age 3 to "early childhood.". Creation of a new diagnostic category called "social communication disorder" (SCD) to include individuals who have difficulties in social communication/interaction but do not meet RRB criteria found in ASD. Removal of Rett syndrome from the classification, on the basis of recent genetic data. Controversy over the New Classification of ASD The new classification of ASDs has been criticized in the literature in different ways. Some authors have suggested that the new classification will narrow the criteria for ASD; thus, some patients may no longer meet the criteria for ASD, in particular, cognitively able individuals and individuals diagnosed with AS and PDD-NOS. In short, the argument is although this reduced sensitivity is associated with higher specificity, it has the potential to exert negative effects on the service eligibility, as well as the ability of researchers to integrate information and data from researches conducted under these criteria.[9][6] Other authors claim that the elimination of the specific diagnostic category for Asperger syndrome will increase stigma towards individuals previously diagnosed with AS, based on the assumption that autism-phobic societies perceive autism as a significant disability, whereas AS is associated with the more positive stereotypes.[10][2] In addition, previous research has demonstrated the association of autism with disability and dysfunction, and the association of AS with positive features. Thus, the new inclusion of AS in the category of ASD may have a negative effect on the identity of the individuals who have adopted this label as an identity. However, the literature on the potential impact of the DSM-5 changes on individuals previously diagnosed with AS is limited, and the results can be categorized into those who are supportive, those who are opposed, and those who express mixed feelings concerning the changes.[2]},

	abstract = {Sleep and wake represent two profoundly different states of physiology that arise within the brain from a complex interaction between multiple neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems. These neural networks are, in turn, adjusted by three key drivers that collectively determine the duration, quality, and efficiency of sleep. Two of these drivers are endogenous, namely, the circadian system and a homeostatic hourglass oscillator, while the third is exogenous—our societal structure (social time). In this chapter, we outline the neuroscience of sleep and highlight the links between sleep, mood, cognition, and mental health. We emphasize that the complexity of sleep/wake generation and regulation makes this behavioral cycle very vulnerable to disruption and then explore this concept by examining sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) when the exogenous and endogenous drivers of sleep are in conflict. SCRD can be particularly severe when social timing forces an abnormal pattern of sleep and wake upon our endogenous sleep biology. SCRD is also very common in mental illness, and although well known, this association is poorly understood or treated. Recent studies suggest that the generation of sleep and mental health shares overlapping neural mechanisms such that defects in these endogenous pathways result in pathologies to both behaviors. The evidence for this association is examined in some detail. We conclude this review by suggesting that the emerging understanding of the neurobiology of sleep/wake behavior, and of the health consequences of sleep disruption, will provide new ways to decrease the conflict between biological and societal timing in both the healthy and individuals with mental illness.},

We summarise recent clinical evidence that supports this hypothesis, including the observation that the treatment of SCRD leads to improvements in both the sleep quality and psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia patients. Moreover, many SCRD-associated pathologies, such as impaired cognitive performance, are routinely observed in schizophrenia. We suggest that these associations can be explored at a mechanistic level by using animal models. Specifically, we predict that SCRD should be observed in schizophrenia-relevant mouse models. There is a rapidly accumulating body of evidence which supports this prediction, as summarised in this review. In light of these emerging data, we highlight other models which warrant investigation, and address the potential challenges associated with modelling schizophrenia and SCRD in rodents. Our view is that an understanding of the mechanistic overlap between SCRD and schizophrenia will ultimately lead to novel treatment approaches, which will not only ameliorate SCRD in schizophrenia patients, but also will improve their broader health problems and overall quality of life.},

This review focuses on stress and exercise as potent entrainment signals for both central and peripheral clocks, especially in regard to the timing of stimuli, types of stressors/exercises, and differences in the responses of rodents and humans. We suggest that the common signaling pathways of clock entrainment by stress and exercise involve sympathetic nervous activation and glucocorticoid release. Furthermore, we demonstrate that physiological responses to stress and exercise depend on time of day. Therefore, using exercise to maintain the circadian clock at an appropriate phase and amplitude might be effective for preventing obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {We address leadership emergence and the possibility that there is a partially innate predisposition to occupy a leadership role. Employing twin design methods on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate the heritability of leadership role occupancy at 24\%. Twin studies do not point to specific genes or neurological processes that might be involved. We therefore also conduct association analysis on the available genetic markers. The results show that leadership role occupancy is associated with rs4950, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) residing on a neuronal acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNB3). We replicate this family-based genetic association result on an independent sample in the Framingham Heart Study. This is the first study to identify a specific genotype associated with the tendency to occupy a leadership position. The results suggest that what determines whether an individual occupies a leadership position is the complex product of genetic and environmental influences, with a particular role for rs4950.},

	abstract = {Genetics constitute a crucial risk factor to schizophrenia. In the last decade, molecular genetic research has produced novel findings, infusing optimism about discovering the biological roots of schizophrenia. However, the complexity of the object of inquiry makes it almost impossible for non-specialists in genetics (e.g., many clinicians and researchers) to get a proper understanding and appreciation of the genetic findings and their limitations. This study aims at facilitating such an understanding by providing a brief overview of some of the central methods and findings in schizophrenia genetics, from its historical origins to its current status, and also by addressing some limitations and challenges that confront this field of research. In short, the genetic architecture of schizophrenia has proven to be highly complex, heterogeneous, and polygenic. The disease risk is constituted by numerous common genetic variants of only very small individual effect and by rare, highly penetrant genetic variants of larger effects. In spite of recent advances in molecular genetics, our knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia and the genotype-environment interactions remain limited.},

SCN neurons are heterogeneous and can be classified according to their function, anatomical connections, morphology and/or peptidergic identity. We focus here on gastrin-releasing peptide- (GRP) and on GRP receptor- (GRPr) expressing cells of the SCN. Pharmacological application of GRP in vivo or in vitro can shift the phase of circadian rhythms, and GRPr-deficient mice show blunted photic phase shifting. Given the in vivo and in vitro effects of GRP on circadian behavior and on SCN neuronal activity, we investigated whether the GRPr might be under circadian and/or diurnal control. Using in situ hybridization and autoradiographic receptor binding, we localized the GRPr in the mouse SCN and determined that GRP binding varies with time of day in animals housed in a light-dark cycle but not in conditions of constant darkness. The latter results were confirmed with Western blots of SCN tissue. Together, the present findings reveal that changes in GRPr are light driven and not endogenously organized. Diurnal variation in GRPr activity probably underlies intra-SCN signaling important for entrainment and phase shifting.},

A data mining approach identified extracellular sulfatase 1 (SULF1) as an enzyme expressed on the surface of pancreatic cancer cells. We designed, synthesized, and characterized 2-(2'-sulfooxyphenyl)-6-iodo-4-(3H)-quinazolinone (IQ(2-S)) as well as its radioiodinated form ((125) IQ(2-S)) as a prodrug with potential for hydrolysis by SULF1. IQ(2-S) was successfully docked in silico into three enzymes - homolog of SULF1, alkaline phosphatase, and prostatic acid phosphatase. The incubation of (125) IQ(2-S) and (125) IQ(2-P) with the three enzymes in solution confirms the docking results and enzyme selectivity for the analogs. The hydrolysis of both radioactive compounds produces the water-insoluble, fluorescent product 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-6-[(125) I]iodo-4-(3H)-quinazolinone ((125) IQ(2-OH)). The in vitro incubation of (127) IQ(2-S) and (127) IQ(2-P) with pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate cancer cells expressing studied hydrolases also results in their hydrolysis and the precipitation of (127) IQ(2-OH) fluorescent crystals on the cell surface. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to report the targeting of a radioactive substrate to SULF1 and that this prodrug may be potentially useful in the imaging ((123) I/(124) I/(131) I) and radiotherapy ((131) I) of pancreatic cancer.},

Most pancreatic tumours expressed variable levels of both SULF1 and SULF2 variants including some expression during inflammation and pancreatitis. Many ductal and centro-acinar cell-derived pancreatic tumours are known to evolve into lethal pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas but the present study also detected different stages of such tumour progression in the same tissue biopsies of not only acinar cell origin but also islet cell-derived cancers. The examination of caerulein-induced pancreatic injury and tumorigenesis in a Kras-driven mouse model confirmed the activation and gradual increase of SULF1/SULF2 variants during pancreatitis and tumorigenesis but with reduced levels in Stat3 conditional knockout mice with reduced inflammation. The significance of differential spatial and temporal patterns of specific SULF1/SULF2 splice variant expression during cancer growth became further apparent from their differential stimulatory or inhibitory effects on growth factor activities, tumour growth and angiogenesis not only during in vitro but also in vivo growth thus providing possible novel therapeutic targets.},

OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the differences in SULF1 expression levels between pancreatic cancer and normal tissues, and their correlation with the clinicopathological features and prognosis.
METHODS: A total of 65 pancreatic cancer samples were enrolled in this study. An immunohistochemical assay were used in this study. The relationship between SULF1 expression and clinicopathological features were tested using χ2 test or Fisher's exact test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative survival rates of the patients.
RESULTS: The study showed that the SULF1 expression level was higher in pancreatic cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Analysis of the clinical and pathological data of patients revealed that high SULF1 expression was associated with later T, N, and TNM stages, higher CA19-9 levels, smaller tumor size, and poorer prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that SULF1 could be an indicator of the clinicopathological features and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.},

Hypergeometric test method was used to calculate pivot nodes among ncRNAs, TFs and mRNA based on RAID 2.0 and TRRUST v2 databases. The blue and yellow modules were identified as the core modules associated with PC types. MST1R, TMPRSS, MIR198, SULF1, COL1A1 and FAP were the core genes in the modules. Hypergeometric test results showed that ANCR, miR-3134, MT1DP, LOC154449, LOC28329 and other ncRNAs were key factors driving blue module genes, while LINC-ROR, UCA1, SNORD114-4, HEIH, SNORD114-6 and other ncRNAs were key factors driving yellow module genes. TFs with significant regulatory effect on blue module included LCOR, PIAS4, ZEB1, SNAI2, SMARCA4, etc. and on yellow module included HOXC6, PER2, HOXD3, TWIST2, VHL, etc. The core modules associated with PC types were proved as yellow and blue modules, and important ncRNAs and TFs regulating yellow and blue modules were found.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive diagnostic biomarkers for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA) are warranted to facilitate accurate diagnosis. This study identified diagnostic plasma proteins based on proteomics of tumor secretome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secretome of tumor and normal tissue was collected after resection of PDAC and dCCA. Differentially expressed proteins were measured by mass spectrometry. Selected candidate biomarkers and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in plasma from patients with PDAC (n = 82), dCCA (n = 29), benign disease (BD; n = 30), and healthy donors (HDs; n = 50). Areas under the curve (AUCs) of receiver operator characteristic curves were calculated to determine the discriminative power.
RESULTS: In tumor secretome, 696 discriminatory proteins were identified, including 21 candidate biomarkers. Thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) emerged as promising biomarker. Abundance of THBS2 in plasma from patients with cancer was significantly higher compared to HDs (p {\textless} .001, AUC = 0.844). Combined expression of THBS2 and CA19-9 yielded the optimal discriminatory capacity (AUC = 0.952), similarly for early- and late-stage disease (AUC = 0.971 and AUC = 0.911). Remarkably, this combination demonstrated a power similar to CA19-9 to discriminate cancer from BD (AUC = 0.764), and THBS2 provided an additive value in patients with high expression levels of bilirubin.
CONCLUSION: Our proteome approach identified a promising set of candidate biomarkers. The combined plasma expression of THBS2/CA19-9 is able to accurately distinguish patients with PDAC or dCCA from HD and BD.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The combined plasma expression of thrombospondin-2 and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is able to accurately diagnose patients with pancreatic cancer and distal cholangiocarcinoma. This will facilitate minimally invasive diagnosis for these patients by distinguishing them from healthy individuals and benign diseases.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The inhibition of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reduces desmoplasia and promotes increased vascularity. In contrast to these findings, the Hh ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) is a potent proangiogenic factor in non-tumor models. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms by which SHH affects the tumor stroma and angiogenesis.
METHODS: Mice bearing three different xenografted human PDAC (n = 5/group) were treated with neutralizing antibodies to SHH. After treatment for 7 days, tumors were evaluated and the expression of 38 pro- and antiangiogenic factors was assessed in the tumor cells and their stroma. The effect of SHH on the regulation of pro- and antiangiogenic factors in fibroblasts and its impact on endothelial cells was then further assessed in in vitro model systems.
RESULTS: Inhibition of SHH affected tumor growth, stromal content, and vascularity. Its effect on the Hh signaling pathway was restricted to the stromal compartment of the three cancers. SHH-stimulated angiogenesis indirectly through the reduction of antiangiogenic THBS2 and TIMP2 in stromal cells. An additional direct effect of SHH on endothelial cells depended on the presence of VEGF.
CONCLUSION: Inhibition of Hh signaling reduces tumor vascularity, suggesting that Hh plays a role in the maintenance or formation of the tumor vasculature. Whether the reduction in tumor growth and viability seen in the epithelium is a direct consequence of Hh pathway inhibition, or indirectly caused by its effect on the stroma and vasculature, remains to be evaluated.},

Thrombospondin-2 (THBS2)-an endogenous, anti-angiogenic matrix glycoprotein-may modulate tumor progression. We hypothesized that circulating levels of THBS2 could aid in preoperative prediction of malignant IPMN.
METHODS: Preoperative serum/plasma samples were procured from patients undergoing surgery. Circulating levels of THBS2 were measured (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and compared to surgical pathology IPMN dysplastic grade.
RESULTS: 164 patients underwent THBS2 testing (100 Low/Moderate-IPMN; 64 High-Grade/Invasive-IPMN). Circulating THBS2 (mean ± SD) was greater in High-Grade/Invasive-IPMN than Low/Moderate-grade IPMN (26.6 ± 12.7 ng/mL vs. 20.4 ± 8.2 ng/mL; P {\textless} 0.001). THBS2 (AUC = 0.65) out-performed CA19-9 (n = 144; AUC = 0.59) in predicting IPMN grade. The combination of THBS2, CA19-9, radiographic main-duct involvement, main-duct diameter, age, sex, and BMI (AUC 0.82; n = 137) provided a good prediction model for IPMN grade.
CONCLUSION: Circulating THBS2 is correlated with IPMN dysplasia grade. THBS2 alone did not strongly predict IPMN grade but rather strengthened prediction models for High-Grade/Invasive IPMN when combined with other clinical/biomarker data.},

A depiction of co-dysregulated gene activity in high-grade familial pancreatic cancer (FPC)-related PanIN lesions may characterize the molecular events during the progression from familial PanIN to PDAC. Materials and Methods: We performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify clusters of coexpressed genes associated with FPC-related PanIN lesions in 13 samples with PanIN-2/3 from FPC predisposed individuals, 6 samples with PDAC from sporadic pancreatic cancer (SPC) patients, and 4 samples of normal donor pancreatic tissue. Results: WGCNA identified seven differentially expressed gene (DEG) modules and two commonly expressed gene (CEG) modules with significant enrichment for Gene Ontology (GO) terms in FPC and SPC, including three upregulated (p {\textless} 5e-05) and four downregulated (p {\textless} 6e-04) gene modules in FPC compared to SPC. Among the DEG modules, the upregulated modules include 14 significant genes (p {\textless} 1e-06): ALOX12-AS1, BCL2L11, EHD4, C4B, BTN3A3, NDUFA11, RBM4B, MYOC, ZBTB47, TTTY15, NAPRT, LOC102606465, LOC100505711, and PTK2. The downregulated modules include 170 genes (p {\textless} 1e-06), among them 13 highly significant genes (p {\textless} 1e-10): COL10A1, SAMD9, PLPP4, COMP, POSTN, IGHV4-31, THBS2, MMP9, FNDC1, HOPX, TMEM200A, INHBA, and SULF1. The DEG modules are enriched for GO terms related to mitochondrial structure and adenosine triphosphate metabolic processes, extracellular structure and binding properties, humoral and complement mediated immune response, ligand-gated ion channel activity, and transmembrane receptor activity. Among the CEG modules, IL22RA1, DPEP1, and BCAT1 were found as highly connective hub genes associated with both FPC and SPC. Conclusion: FPC-related PanIN lesions exhibit a common molecular basis with SPC as shown by gene network activities and commonly expressed high-connectivity hub genes. The differential molecular pathology of FPC and SPC involves multiple coexpressed gene clusters enriched for GO terms including extracellular activities and mitochondrion function.},

	doi = {10.1111/liv.14487},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive cholestatic liver disease without a curative medical therapy. The human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A play a major role in the detoxification and elimination of bilirubin, bile acids and xenobiotics. Whether genetic UGT1A variants determine course and outcome of PSC has not yet been described.
METHODS: A large cohort of German PSC patients with a long-term-follow-up was genotyped for UGT1A variants including UGT1A1*28, UGT1A3-66 T{\textgreater}C and UGT1A7 p.N129K/p.R131K using TaqMan 5'-nuclease assays. Results were correlated with clinical characteristics and transplant-free survival.
RESULTS: About 331 patients with PSC were included in the study (69.9\% male, mean age at diagnosis 32.6 years). Median transplant-free survival was 14.9 years. Patients with wild-type alleles of all three UGT1A genes had a longer transplant-free survival (17.2 vs. 14.4 years, P = .048) than patients carrying a homozygous or heterozygous SNP variant in at least one of the UGT1A1, UGT1A3 or UGT1A7 genes. Additionally, we found that patients carrying wild-type alleles of all three UGT1A genes had lower serum bilirubin (25 vs. 38 µmol/L, P = .02) and serum cholesterol (195 vs. 223 mg/dL), P = .035) at first presentation. Furthermore, inflammatory bowel disease was found to be associated with wild-type UGT1A alleles (82.2\% vs. 68.4\%, P = .046).
CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort shows an association with single nucleotide polymorphisms of the UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT1A7 genes and outcome in PSC. Thus, UGT1A variants may represent a tool for the prognostic stratification of PSC patients and establish a link between disease progression and the regulation of detoxification by glucuronidation in PSC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in Crohn's disease (CD). As serum bilirubin represents the major endogenous antioxidant, this article aimed to evaluate in a clinical study, whether serum bilirubin levels and genes affecting its systemic concentrations are associated with CD.
METHODS: This exploratory case-control study was based on pediatric (n = 119) and adult (n = 504) patients with CD and 370 appropriate healthy control subjects. The (GT)n and (TA)n dinucleotide variations in heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1) gene promoters were determined by fragment analysis. Serum bilirubin levels were compared in a subset of 90 cases and 229 controls, for whom biochemical data were available.
RESULTS: Substantially lower serum bilirubin levels were detected in patients with CD compared with controls (7.4 versus 12.1 μmol/L, P {\textless} 10). Serum bilirubin levels were significantly lower in patients with CD within all UGT1A1*28 genotypes (P {\textless} 0.05). UGT1A1*28 homozygotes with wild-type NOD2 gene variant exhibited significant delay in CD manifestation (P = 0.004), while the protective effect of UGT1A1*28 homozygosity was lost in those patients with mutated NOD2 gene. No associations between CD risk and individual HMOX1 gene variants were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with significantly low serum bilirubin levels, most likely as a result of increased oxidative stress accompanying this inflammatory disease. UGT1A1*28 allele homozygosity, responsible for higher bilirubin levels, seems to be an important modifier of CD manifestation.},

Because there is evidence that their expression and function may be affected during inflammatory conditions, we investigated gene expression, protein abundance, and regulation of relevant intestinal transporters and metabolizing enzymes in the intestinal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Specimens from inflamed and noninflamed tissues of 10 patients with UC as well as colonic control tissues of 10 patients without inflammation were subjected to gene (9 enzymes, 15 transporters, 9 cytokines) and microRNA (N = 54) expression analysis. Protein abundance was quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based targeted proteomics. Gene expression of several metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, UGT1A1) and transporters such as ABCB1 (ABCB1), ABCG2 (ABCG2), and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1, SLC16A1) were significantly decreased during inflammation and negatively correlated to microRNAs. On contrary, multidrug resistance-protein 4 (MRP4, ABCC4), organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1, SLCO2B1), and organic cation transporter-like 2 (ORCTL2, SLC22A18) were significantly elevated in inflamed tissue. However, at protein level, these findings could only be confirmed for MCT1. UC is associated with complex changes in the intestinal expression of enzymes, transporters, cytokines, and microRNAs, which may affect efficacy of anti-inflammatory drug therapy or the disease state itself.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their capturing by antioxidants results in oxidative stress, this may play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since bilirubin is an important endogenous antioxidant, increased levels of bilirubin may protect against IBD. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is the only enzyme involved in the conjugation of bilirubin and the common UGT1A1*28 allele in the UGT1A1 gene, which is strongly associated with Gilbert's syndrome in Caucasians, results in elevated plasma bilirubin levels.
AIMS: To test the hypothesis that the UGT1A1*28 allele is associated with lower disease susceptibility to, and disease behavior within, IBD. In addition, a possible altered risk for developing IBD-drug related side-effects was explored.
METHODOLOGY: Genomic DNA of 751 patients with IBD (209 patients with ulcerative colitis and 542 patients with Crohn's disease) and 930 healthy controls was genotyped for the UGT1A1*28 promoter polymorphism, and genotype distribution was compared between patients and controls. Genotype phenotype interactions were also investigated.
RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease significantly less often bear the UGT1A1*28 homozygous genotype compared to the control group, with an odds ratio of 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.42-0.98. The ulcerative colitis group showed no significant differences compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: The homozygous state of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism, associated with higher serum bilirubin levels, may be protective for the development of Crohn's disease, suggesting that the anti-oxidant capacity of bilirubin may play a part.},

	abstract = {Purpose: High-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) are aggressive premalignant lesions, associated with risk of progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A depiction of co-dysregulated gene activity in high-grade familial pancreatic cancer (FPC)-related PanIN lesions may characterize the molecular events during the progression from familial PanIN to PDAC. Materials and Methods: We performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify clusters of coexpressed genes associated with FPC-related PanIN lesions in 13 samples with PanIN-2/3 from FPC predisposed individuals, 6 samples with PDAC from sporadic pancreatic cancer (SPC) patients, and 4 samples of normal donor pancreatic tissue. Results: WGCNA identified seven differentially expressed gene (DEG) modules and two commonly expressed gene (CEG) modules with significant enrichment for Gene Ontology (GO) terms in FPC and SPC, including three upregulated (p {\textless} 5e-05) and four downregulated (p {\textless} 6e-04) gene modules in FPC compared to SPC. Among the DEG modules, the upregulated modules include 14 significant genes (p {\textless} 1e-06): ALOX12-AS1, BCL2L11, EHD4, C4B, BTN3A3, NDUFA11, RBM4B, MYOC, ZBTB47, TTTY15, NAPRT, LOC102606465, LOC100505711, and PTK2. The downregulated modules include 170 genes (p {\textless} 1e-06), among them 13 highly significant genes (p {\textless} 1e-10): COL10A1, SAMD9, PLPP4, COMP, POSTN, IGHV4-31, THBS2, MMP9, FNDC1, HOPX, TMEM200A, INHBA, and SULF1. The DEG modules are enriched for GO terms related to mitochondrial structure and adenosine triphosphate metabolic processes, extracellular structure and binding properties, humoral and complement mediated immune response, ligand-gated ion channel activity, and transmembrane receptor activity. Among the CEG modules, IL22RA1, DPEP1, and BCAT1 were found as highly connective hub genes associated with both FPC and SPC. Conclusion: FPC-related PanIN lesions exhibit a common molecular basis with SPC as shown by gene network activities and commonly expressed high-connectivity hub genes. The differential molecular pathology of FPC and SPC involves multiple coexpressed gene clusters enriched for GO terms including extracellular activities and mitochondrion function.},

Accurate identification of driver genes and driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalizing treatment based on accurate stratification of patients. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity many driver mutations within a gene occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from non-driver mutations. We have developed a novel method for identifying cancer driver genes. Our approach utilizes multiple complementary types of information, specifically cellular phenotypes, cellular locations, functions, and whole body physiological phenotypes as features. We demonstrate that our method can accurately identify known cancer driver genes and distinguish between their role in different types of cancer. In addition to confirming known driver genes, we identify several novel candidate driver genes. We demonstrate the utility of our method by validating its predictions in nasopharyngeal cancer and colorectal cancer using whole exome and whole genome sequencing.},

Inherent in this proposal is that biological mechanisms associated with clinical ASD may also underpin variation in autistic-like traits within the general population. A GWA study using 2,462,046 SNPs was undertaken for ASD in 965 individuals from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. No SNP associations reached genome-wide significance (p {\textless} 5.0 × 10−8). However, investigations into nominal observed SNP associations (p {\textless} 1.0 × 10−5) add support to two positional candidate genes previously implicated in ASD etiology, PRKCB1, and CBLN1. The rs198198 SNP (p = 9.587 × 10−6), is located within an intron of the protein kinase C, beta 1 (PRKCB1) gene on chromosome 16p11. The PRKCB1 gene has been previously reported in linkage and association studies for ASD, and its mRNA expression has been shown to be significantly down regulated in ASD cases compared with controls. The rs16946931 SNP (p = 1.78 × 10−6) is located in a region flanking the Cerebellin 1 (CBLN1) gene on chromosome 16q12.1. The CBLN1 gene is involved with synaptogenesis and is part of a gene family previously implicated in ASD. This GWA study is only the second to examine SNPs associated with autistic-like traits in the general population, and provides evidence to support roles for the PRKCB1 and CBLN1 genes in risk of clinical ASD.},

Included in this study were 31 mood episodes of 26 BD patients, and 18 controls. Circadian rhythms of BD were evaluated at admission, at 2-week intervals during hospitalization, and at discharge. All participants wore wrist actigraphs during the studies. Saliva and buccal cells were obtained at 8:00, 11:00, 15:00, 19:00, and 23:00 for two consecutive days. Collected saliva and buccal cells were used for analysis of the cortisol and gene circadian rhythm, respectively. Circadian rhythms had different phases during acute mood episodes of BD compared to recovered states. In 23 acute manic episodes, circadian phases were {\textasciitilde}7hour advanced (equivalent to {\textasciitilde}17hour delayed). Phases of 21 out of these 23 cases returned to normal by {\textasciitilde}7hour delay along with treatment, but two out of 23 cases returned to normal by {\textasciitilde}17hour advance. In three cases of mixed manic episodes, the phases were {\textasciitilde}6–7hour delayed. For five cases of depressive episodes, circadian rhythms phases were {\textasciitilde}4–5hour delayed. After treatment, circadian phases resembled those of healthy controls. Circadian misalignment due to circadian rhythm phase shifts might be a pathophysiological mechanism of BD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Altered physical activity is an important feature of depression. It is manifested in psychomotor retardation, agitation and withdrawal from engagement in normal activities. Modern devices for activity monitoring (actigraphs) make it possible to monitor physical activity unobtrusively but the validity of actigraphy as an indicator of mood state is uncertain. We carried out a systematic review of digital actigraphy in patients with depression to investigate the associations between measured physical activity and depression.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies were identified from Medline, EMBASE and Psycinfo databases and included if they were either case control or longitudinal studies of actigraphy in adults aged between 18 and 65 diagnosed with a depressive disorder. Outcomes were daytime and night-time activity and actigraphic measures of sleep.
RESULTS: We identified 19 eligible papers from 16 studies (412 patients). Case control studies showed less daytime activity in patients with depression (standardised mean difference -0.76, 95\% confidence intervals -1.05 to -0.47). Longitudinal studies showed moderate increase in daytime activity (0.53, 0.20 to 0.87) and a reduction in night-time activity (-0.36, -0.65 to -0.06) over the course of treatment.
LIMITATIONS: All study participants were unblinded. Only seven papers included patients treated in the community.
CONCLUSIONS: Actigraphy is a potentially valuable source of additional information about patients with depression. However, there are no clear guidelines for use of actigraphy in studies of patients with depression. Further studies should investigate patients treated in the community. Additional work to develop algorithms for differentiating behaviour patterns is also needed.},

We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.},

	abstract = {Objective To use genetic variants as unconfounded proxies of C reactive protein concentration to study its causal role in coronary heart disease.
Design Mendelian randomisation meta-analysis of individual participant data from 47 epidemiological studies in 15 countries.
Participants 194 418 participants, including 46 557 patients with prevalent or incident coronary heart disease. Information was available on four CRP gene tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3093077, rs1205, rs1130864, rs1800947), concentration of C reactive protein, and levels of other risk factors.
Main outcome measures Risk ratios for coronary heart disease associated with genetically raised C reactive protein versus risk ratios with equivalent differences in C reactive protein concentration itself, adjusted for conventional risk factors and variability in risk factor levels within individuals.
Results CRP variants were each associated with up to 30\% per allele difference in concentration of C reactive protein (P{\textless}10−34) and were unrelated to other risk factors. Risk ratios for coronary heart disease per additional copy of an allele associated with raised C reactive protein were 0.93 (95\% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.00) for rs3093077; 1.00 (0.98 to 1.02) for rs1205; 0.98 (0.96 to 1.00) for rs1130864; and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.03) for rs1800947. In a combined analysis, the risk ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.00 (0.90 to 1.13) per 1 SD higher genetically raised natural log (ln) concentration of C reactive protein. The genetic findings were discordant with the risk ratio observed for coronary heart disease of 1.33 (1.23 to 1.43) per 1 SD higher circulating ln concentration of C reactive protein in prospective studies (P=0.001 for difference).
Conclusion Human genetic data indicate that C reactive protein concentration itself is unlikely to be even a modest causal factor in coronary heart disease.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13229-017-0137-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) {\textless}1.15).
METHODS: We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls).
RESULTS: We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes including PITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation and CUEDC2 previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0.23; P = 9 × 10-6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such as FOXP1 at 3p13, ATP2B2 at 3p25.3, and a 'neurodevelopmental hub' on chromosome 8p11.23.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such as EXT1, ASTN2, MACROD2, and HDAC4.},

	abstract = {Sleep has numerous advantages for aligning clinical and preclinical (basic neuroscience) studies of neuropsychiatric illness. Sleep has high translational relevance, because the same endpoints can be studied in humans and laboratory animals. In addition, sleep experiments are conducive to continuous data collection over long periods (hours/days/weeks) and can be based on highly objective neurophysiological measures. Here, we provide a translationally-oriented review on what is currently known about sleep in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including ASD-related conditions, thought to have genetic, environmental, or mixed etiologies. In humans, ASD is frequently associated with comorbid medical conditions including sleep disorders. Animal models used in the study of ASD frequently recapitulate dysregulation of sleep and biological (diurnal, circadian) rhythms, suggesting common pathophysiologies across species. As our understanding of the neurobiology of ASD and sleep each become more refined, it is conceivable that sleep-derived metrics may offer more powerful biomarkers of altered neurophysiology in ASD than the behavioral tests currently used in humans or lab animals. As such, the study of sleep in animal models for ASD may enable fundamentally new insights on the condition and represent a basis for strategies that enable the development of more effective therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Gene expression programmes driving cell identity are established by tightly regulated transcription factors that auto- and cross-regulate in a feed-forward manner, forming core regulatory circuitries (CRCs). CRC transcription factors create and engage super-enhancers by recruiting acetylation writers depositing permissive H3K27ac chromatin marks. These super-enhancers are largely associated with BET proteins, including BRD4, that influence higher-order chromatin structure. The orchestration of these events triggers accessibility of RNA polymerase machinery and the imposition of lineage-specific gene expression. In cancers, CRCs drive cell identity by superimposing developmental programmes on a background of genetic alterations. Further, the establishment and maintenance of oncogenic states are reliant on CRCs that drive factors involved in tumour development. Hence, the molecular dissection of CRC components driving cell identity and cancer state can contribute to elucidating mechanisms of diversion from pre-determined developmental programmes and highlight cancer dependencies. These insights can provide valuable opportunities for identifying and re-purposing drug targets. In this article, we review the current understanding of CRCs across solid and liquid malignancies and avenues of investigation for drug development efforts. We also review techniques used to understand CRCs and elaborate the indication of discussed CRC transcription factors in the wider context of cancer CRC models.},

These methods hold significant promise for future discovery, particularly when combined with computational modeling. However, genome-scale experiments are costly and laborious, yielding “big data” that are conceptually and statistically difficult to analyze. There is no obvious consensus regarding design or analysis. Here we discuss the relevant technical considerations to generate reproducible, statistically sound, and broadly useful genome-scale data. Rather than suggest a set of rigid rules, we aim to codify principles by which investigators, reviewers, and readers of the primary literature can evaluate the suitability of different experimental designs for measuring different aspects of biological rhythms. We introduce CircaInSilico, a web-based application for generating synthetic genome biology data to benchmark statistical methods for studying biological rhythms.

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior provide a selective advantage by enabling organisms to anticipate rhythmic changes in their environment. These rhythms are based upon a molecular clock generated via an intracellular transcriptional–translational feedback loop involving a number of key clock genes. However, to be of practical use, circadian rhythms need to be entrained to the external environment. In mammals, the primary signal for entrainment is light detected by the photoreceptors of the eye. Research on the mechanisms of photic entrainment has identified a novel photoreceptor system in the retina, consisting of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanopsin. Light input from these retinal photoreceptors reaches the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) via the retinohypothalamic tract, where it then interacts with the molecular clock to bring about entrainment. This chapter focuses on the retinal photoreceptors mediating entrainment, and how light information from the retina is transmitted to the SCN, before detailing recent advances in our understanding of how the molecular clock within the SCN is regulated by light input. Finally, the primary assays that have been used to measure photic entrainment are described.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Several genetic causes of ASD have been identified and this has enabled researchers to construct mouse models. Mouse behavioral tests reveal impaired social interaction and communication, as well as increased repetitive behavior and behavioral inflexibility in these mice, which correspond to core behavioral deficits observed in individuals with ASD. However, the connection between these behavioral abnormalities and the underlying dysregulation in neuronal circuits and synaptic function is poorly understood. Moreover, different components of the ASD phenotype may be linked to dysfunction in different brain regions, making it even more challenging to chart the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in ASD. Here we summarize the research on mouse models of ASD and their contribution to understanding pathophysiological mechanisms. Specifically, we emphasize abnormal serotonin production and regulation, as well as the disruption in circadian rhythms and sleep that are observed in a subset of ASD, and propose that spatiotemporal disturbances in brainstem development may be a primary cause of ASD that propagates towards the cerebral cortex.},

Although there is substantial variation in the results depending upon the methodological characteristics of the studies, the findings converge in demonstrating that approximately one fourth of youth experience a mental disorder during the past year, and about one third across their lifetimes. Anxiety disorders are the most frequent conditions in children, followed by behavior disorders, mood disorders, and substance use disorders. Fewer than half of youth with current mental disorders receive mental health specialty treatment. However, those with the most severe disorders tend to receive mental health services. Current issues that are now being identified in the field of child psychiatric epidemiology include: refinement of classification and assessment, inclusion of young children in epidemiologic surveys, integration of child and adult psychiatric epidemiology, and evaluation of both mental and physical disorders in children.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The emergence of psychosis in at-risk individuals results from interactions between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors, possibly involving dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Hypercorticism was indeed described in schizophrenia and ultra-high-risk states, but its association with clinical outcome has yet to be demonstrated. The impact of stress through cortisol may vary depending on the expression level of genes related to the stress pathway.
Methods: To test this hypothesis, we selected NR3C1, the gene encoding the glucocorticoid receptor, and modeled through logistic regression how its peripheral expression could explain some of the risk of psychosis, independently of peripheral cortisol levels, in a French longitudinal prospective cohort of 133 at-risk individuals, adjusted for sex, age, cannabis, and antipsychotic medication intake. We then performed a genome-wide association analysis, stratified by sex (55 females and 78 males), to identify NR3C1 expression quantitative trait loci to be used as instrumental variables in a Mendelian randomization framework.
Results: NR3C1 expression was significantly associated with a higher risk of conversion to psychosis (OR = 2.03, p = 0.03), independently of any other factor. Cortisol was not associated with outcome nor correlated with NR3C1. In the female subgroup, rs6849528 was associated both with NR3C1 mRNA levels (p = 0.015, Effect-Size = 2.7) and conversion (OR = 8.24, p = 0.03).
Conclusions: For the same level of cortisol, NR3C1 expression increases psychotic risk, independently of sex, age, cannabis, and antipsychotic intake. In females, Mendelian randomization confirmed NR3C1's effect on outcome to be unbiased by any environmental confounder.},

Summary-level data for seven psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, bipolar disorder, insomnia, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicide attempts, and schizophrenia, was obtained from large genetic consortia and genome-wide association studies. The odds ratios of genetically predicted smoking initiation were 1.96 for suicide attempts (95\% CI 1.70, 2.27; p = 4.5 × 10-20), 1.69 for post-traumatic stress disorder (95\% CI 1.32, 2.16; p = 2.5 × 10-5), 1.54 for schizophrenia (95\% CI 1.35, 1.75; p = 1.6 × 10-10), 1.41 for bipolar disorder (95\% CI 1.25, 1.59; p = 1.8 × 10-8), 1.38 for major depressive disorder (95\% CI 1.31, 1.45; p = 2.3 × 10-38), 1.20 for insomnia (95\% CI 1.14, 1.25; p = 6.0 × 10-14) and 1.17 for anxiety (95\% CI 0.98, 1.40; p = 0.086). Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent and no horizontal pleiotropy was detected in MR-Egger analysis. However, the associations with suicide attempts, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and anxiety might be related to possible reverse causality or weak instrument bias. This study found that cigarette smoking was causally associated with increased risks of a number of psychiatric disorders.

	abstract = {To date more than 3700 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published that look at the genetic contributions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to human conditions or human phenotypes. Through these studies many highly significant SNPs have been identified for hundreds of diseases or medical conditions. However, the extent to which GWAS-identified SNPs or combinations of SNP biomarkers can predict disease risk is not well known. One of the most commonly used approaches to assess the performance of predictive biomarkers is to determine the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC). We have developed an R package called G-WIZ to generate ROC curves and calculate the AUROC using summary-level GWAS data. We first tested the performance of G-WIZ by using AUROC values derived from patient-level SNP data, as well as literature-reported AUROC values. We found that G-WIZ predicts the AUROC with {\textless}3\% error. Next, we used the summary level GWAS data from GWAS Central to determine the ROC curves and AUROC values for 569 different GWA studies spanning 219 different conditions. Using these data we found a small number of GWA studies with SNP-derived risk predictors that have very high AUROCs ({\textgreater}0.75). On the other hand, the average GWA study produces a multi-SNP risk predictor with an AUROC of 0.55. Detailed AUROC comparisons indicate that most SNP-derived risk predictions are not as good as clinically based disease risk predictors. All our calculations (ROC curves, AUROCs, explained heritability) are in a publicly accessible database called GWAS-ROCS (http://gwasrocs.ca). The G-WIZ code is freely available for download at https://github.com/jonaspatronjp/GWIZ-Rscript/.},

	abstract = {The apparently large genetic contribution to the aetiology of mental illness presents a formidable puzzle. Unlike common physical disorders, mental illness usually has an onset early in the reproductive age and is associated with substantial reproductive disadvantage. Therefore, genetic variants associated with vulnerability to mental illness should be under strong negative selection pressure and be eliminated from the genetic pool through natural selection. Still, mental disorders are common and twin studies indicate a strong genetic contribution to their aetiology. Several theories have been advanced to explain the paradox of high heritability and reproductive disadvantage associated with the same common phenotype, but none provides a satisfactory explanation for all types of mental illness. At the same time, identification of the molecular substrate underlying the large genetic contribution to the aetiology of mental illness is proving more difficult than expected. The quest for genetic variants associated with vulnerability to mental illness is predicated upon the common disease/common variant (CDCV) hypothesis. On the basis of a summary of evidence, it is concluded that the CDCV hypothesis is untenable for most types of mental illness. An alternative evolution-informed framework is proposed, which suggests that gene–environment interactions and rare genetic variants constitute most of the genetic contribution to mental illness. Common mental illness with mild reproductive disadvantage is likely to have a large contribution from interactions between common genetic variants and environmental exposures. Severe mental illness that confers strong reproductive disadvantage is likely to have a large and pleiotropic contribution from rare variants of recent origin. This framework points to a need for a paradigm change in genetic research to enable major progress in elucidating the aetiology of mental illness.},

	abstract = {A population association has consistently been observed between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and the "class 1" alleles of the region of tandem-repeat DNA (5' flanking polymorphism [5'FP]) adjacent to the insulin gene on chromosome 11p. This finding suggests that the insulin gene region contains a gene or genes contributing to IDDM susceptibility. However, several studies that have sought to show linkage with IDDM by testing for cosegregation in affected sib pairs have failed to find evidence for linkage. As means for identifying genes for complex diseases, both the association and the affected-sib-pairs approaches have limitations. It is well known that population association between a disease and a genetic marker can arise as an artifact of population structure, even in the absence of linkage. On the other hand, linkage studies with modest numbers of affected sib pairs may fail to detect linkage, especially if there is linkage heterogeneity. We consider an alternative method to test for linkage with a genetic marker when population association has been found. Using data from families with at least one affected child, we evaluate the transmission of the associated marker allele from a heterozygous parent to an affected offspring. This approach has been used by several investigators, but the statistical properties of the method as a test for linkage have not been investigated. In the present paper we describe the statistical basis for this "transmission test for linkage disequilibrium" (transmission/disequilibrium test [TDT]). We then show the relationship of this test to tests of cosegregation that are based on the proportion of haplotypes or genes identical by descent in affected sibs. The TDT provides strong evidence for linkage between the 5'FP and susceptibility to IDDM. The conclusions from this analysis apply in general to the study of disease associations, where genetic markers are usually closely linked to candidate genes. When a disease is found to be associated with such a marker, the TDT may detect linkage even when haplotype-sharing tests do not.},

	abstract = {Background
Phenotypic heterogeneity in autism has long been conjectured to be a
major hindrance to the discovery of genetic risk factors, leading to
numerous attempts to stratify children based on phenotype to increase power
of discovery studies. This approach, however, is based on the hypothesis
that phenotypic heterogeneity closely maps to genetic variation, which has
not been tested. Our study examines the impact of sub-phenotyping of a
well-characterized ASD sample on genetic homogeneity and the ability to
discover common genetic variants conferring liability to ASD.

Methods
Genome-wide genotypic data of 2576 families from the Simons Simplex
Collection (SSC) were analyzed in the overall sample and phenotypic
subgroups defined on the basis of diagnosis, IQ, and symptom profiles. We
conducted a family-based association study as well as estimating
heritability and evaluating allele scores for each phenotypic subgroup.

Results
Association analyses revealed no genome-wide significant association
signal. Sub-phenotyping did not increase power substantially. Moreover,
allele scores built from the most associated SNPs, based on the odds ratio
in the full sample, predicted case status in subsets of the sample equally
well and heritability estimates were very similar for all subgroups.

Conclusions
In genome-wide association analysis of the SSC sample, reducing
phenotypic heterogeneity had at most a modest impact on genetic homogeneity.
Our results are based on a relatively small sample, one with greater
homogeneity than the entire population; if they apply more broadly, they
imply that analysis of sub-phenotypes is not a productive path forward for
discovering genetic risk variants in ASD.},

	abstract = {More than a century ago, Wilhelm Johannsen proposed the terms "genotype" and "phenotype" to study heredity. Much of what we know about genetics and behavior has evolved since then, especially how causality from genotypes can be inferred from observational studies of phenotypes. Unfortunately, there are genotypes that produce complex clinical-behavioral phenotypes-pleiotropy. In addition, there are often many genotypes that produce the same phenotype, adding a layer of complexity in establishing valid genotype-phenotype relationships. Unlike the relative simplicity of some phenotypes, behavioral phenotypes, especially those characteristics considered aberrant, are multidimensional and often not easily defined operationally. An alternate approach which attempts to identify less evident manifestations below the level of the phenotype but along the pathway to the prospective genotype-endophenotypes-could prove useful in detecting genes that generate these markers. However, operational definitions of intermediate phenotypes vary, less overt neurobiological expressions for some disorders-autism-have not been found, and studies of endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia have been not been very successful. Another approach, suggested by Sewall Wright, uses path analysis to identify causal variables that produce phenotypes. Innovative models of causality have been developed recently by genetic epidemiologists that incorporate Mendel's second law, and Mendelian randomization has been successful in identifying genotypes associated with some diseases, for example, diabetes and cancer. Regrettably, shortcomings regarding genetic markers associated with intermediate phenotypes have been found, although there are statistical procedures to remedy matters. As in any science, genetic researchers need to consider carefully the models of causality they choose.},

	abstract = {Background
Behavioral phenotypical continua from health to disease suggest common underlying mechanisms with quantitative rather than qualitative differences. Until recently, autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia were considered distinct nosologic entities. However, emerging evidence contributes to the blurring of symptomatic and genetic boundaries between these conditions. The present study aimed at quantifying behavioral phenotypes shared by autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia to prepare the ground for biological pathway analyses.

Methods
Specific items of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were employed and summed up to form a dimensional autism severity score (PAUSS). The score was created in a schizophrenia sample (N = 1156) and validated in adult high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients (N = 165). To this end, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), the Autism (AQ) and Empathy Quotient (EQ) self-rating questionnaires were applied back to back with the newly developed PAUSS.

Results
PAUSS differentiated between ASD, schizophrenia and a disease-control sample and substantially correlated with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Patients with ADOS scores ≥12 obtained highest, those with scores {\textless}7 lowest PAUSS values. AQ and EQ were not found to vary dependent on ADOS diagnosis. ROC curves for ADOS and PAUSS resulted in AuC values of 0.9 and 0.8, whereas AQ and EQ performed at chance level in the prediction of ASD.

Conclusions
This work underscores the convergence of schizophrenia negative symptoms and autistic phenotypes. PAUSS evolved as a measure capturing the continuous nature of autistic behaviors. The definition of extreme-groups based on the dimensional PAUSS may permit future investigations of genetic constellations modulating autistic phenotypes.},

These ontologies formally represent the classes and relations assumed to exist within a domain. As scientific domains are deeply interlinked, so too are their representations. While individual ontologies can be tested for consistency and coherency using automated reasoning methods, systematically combining ontologies of multiple domains together may reveal previously hidden contradictions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We developed a method that tests for hidden unsatisfiabilities in an ontology that arise when combined with other ontologies. For this purpose, we combine sets of ontologies and use automated reasoning to determine whether unsatisfiable classes are present. We test the mutual consistency of the OBO Foundry and the OBO ontologies and find that the combined OBO Foundry gives rise to at least 636 unsatisfiable classes, while the OBO ontologies give rise to more than 300,000 unsatisfiable classes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We design and implement a novel algorithm that can determine justifications for contradictions across extremely large and complicated ontologies, and use these justifications to semi-automatically repair ontologies by identifying the minimal set of axioms that, when removed, result in a consistent and coherent set of ontologies. We applied our algorithm to each combination of OBO ontologies that resulted in unsatisfiable classes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We identified a large set of hidden unsatisfiability across a broad range of biomedical ontologies, and we find that this large set of unsatisfiable classes is the result of a relatively small amount of axiomatic disagreements. Our results show that hidden unsatisfiability is a serious problem in ontology interoperability; however, our results also provide a way towards more consistent ontologies by addressing the issues we identified.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD.},

Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-11-441},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: most biomedical ontologies are represented in the OBO Flatfile Format, which is an easy-to-use graph-based ontology language. The semantics of the OBO Flatfile Format 1.2 enforces a strict predetermined interpretation of relationship statements between classes. It does not allow flexible specifications that provide better approximations of the intuitive understanding of the considered relations. If relations cannot be accurately expressed then ontologies built upon them may contain false assertions and hence lead to false inferences. Ontologies in the OBO Foundry must formalize the semantics of relations according to the OBO Relationship Ontology (RO). Therefore, being able to accurately express the intended meaning of relations is of crucial importance. Since the Web Ontology Language (OWL) is an expressive language with a formal semantics, it is suitable to de ne the meaning of relations accurately.
RESULTS: we developed a method to provide definition patterns for relations between classes using OWL and describe a novel implementation of the RO based on this method. We implemented our extension in software that converts ontologies in the OBO Flatfile Format to OWL, and also provide a prototype to extract relational patterns from OWL ontologies using automated reasoning. The conversion software is freely available at http://bioonto.de/obo2owl, and can be accessed via a web interface.
CONCLUSIONS: explicitly defining relations permits their use in reasoning software and leads to a more flexible and powerful way of representing biomedical ontologies. Using the extended langua0067e and semantics avoids several mistakes commonly made in formalizing biomedical ontologies, and can be used to automatically detect inconsistencies. The use of our method enables the use of graph-based ontologies in OWL, and makes complex OWL ontologies accessible in a graph-based form. Thereby, our method provides the means to gradually move the representation of biomedical ontologies into formal knowledge representation languages that incorporates an explicit semantics. Our method facilitates the use of OWL-based software in the back-end while ontology curators may continue to develop ontologies with an OBO-style front-end.},

	doi = {10.2202/1544-6115.1128},
	abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

	abstract = {Background: A compelling number of studies, conducted in both children and adults, have reported an association between sleep disturbances/circadian sleep alterations and autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the data are sparse and the nature of this link is still unclear. The present review aimed to systematically collect the literature data relevant on sleep disturbances and circadian sleep dysrhythmicity related to ASD across all ages and to provide an integrative theoretical framework of their association., 
Methods: A systematic review of the MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane databases was conducted from November 2018 to February 2019. The search strategies used were MeSH headings and keywords for “sleep–wake circadian rhythms” OR “circadian sleep disorders” OR “sleep–wake pattern” OR “sleep disorders” OR “melatonin” AND “autism spectrum disorder” OR “autism”., 
Results: One hundred and three studies were identified, 15 regarded circadian sleep dysrhythmicity, 74 regarded sleep disturbances, and 17 regarded melatonin alterations in children and adults with ASD. Our findings suggested that autistic subjects frequently present sleep disturbances in particular short sleep duration, low sleep quality/efficiency, and circadian sleep desynchronization such as delayed phases and/or eveningness. Sleep disturbances and circadian sleep alterations have been related to the severity of autistic symptoms. Genetic studies have shown polymorphisms in circadian CLOCK genes and in genes involved in melatonin pathways in subjects with ASD., 
Conclusions: Sleep disturbances and circadian sleep alterations are frequent in subjects with autistic symptoms. These subjects have shown polymorphisms in clock genes expression and in genes involved in melatonin production. The impairment of circadian sleep regulation may increase the individual’s vulnerability to develop symptoms of ASD by altering the sleep regulation in toto, which plays a key role in normal brain development. Even though controversies and “research gaps” are present in literature at this point, we may hypothesize a bidirectional relation between circadian sleep dysfunction and ASD. In particular, circadian sleep dysrhythmicity may predispose to develop ASD symptoms and vice versa within a self-reinforcing feedback loop. By targeting sleep disturbances and circadian sleep dysrhythmicity, we may improve treatment strategies for both children and adults with ASD.},

SPs can be lifelong and have been reported that adults on the autistic spectrum with and without intellectual disability (ID) present SPs (longer sleep latency, frequent night awakenings, and circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders). A prospective, objective sleep study was conducted in 41 adults with ASD (33 ± 6 years old) and ID and 51 typically developing adults (33 ± 5 years old) using ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) recording wrist temperature, motor activity, body position, sleep, and light intensity. The findings indicated that individuals with ASD presented sleep difficulties including low sleep efficiency, prolonged sleep latency and increased number and length of night awakenings, together with daily sedentary behavior, and increased nocturnal activity. Furthermore, indications of an advanced sleep–wake phase disorder were found in these autistic adults. Examining sleep and markers of the circadian system showed significant differences between adults with ASD and ID and an age-matched, healthy adult population. The sleep disturbances described for this sample of adults with ASD and ID are similar to those of already described for adults with ASD without ID; their relationship with intellectual ability should be further studied.

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in the role of biological and behavioral rhythms in typical and atypical development. Recent studies in cognitive and developmental psychology have highlighted the importance of rhythmicity and synchrony of motor, emotional and relational rhythms in early development of social communication. The synchronization of rhythms allows tuning and adaptation to the external environment. The role of melatonin in the ontogenetic establishment of circadian rhythms and the synchronization of peripheral oscillators suggests that this hormone might be also involved in the synchrony of motor, emotional and relational rhythms. Autism provides a challenging model of physiological and behavioral rhythm disturbances and their possible effects on the development of social communication impairments and repetitive behaviors or interests. This article situates autism as a disorder of biological and behavioral rhythms and reviews the recent literature on the role of rhythmicity and synchrony of rhythms in child development. Finally, the hypothesis is developed that an integrated approach focusing on biological, motor, emotional and relational rhythms may open interesting therapeutic perspectives for children with autism. More specifically, promising avenues are discussed for potential therapeutic benefits in autism spectrum disorder of melatonin combined with developmental behavioral interventions that emphasize synchrony such as the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM).},

	abstract = {Background
Phenotypic heterogeneity in autism has long been conjectured to be a
major hindrance to the discovery of genetic risk factors, leading to
numerous attempts to stratify children based on phenotype to increase power
of discovery studies. This approach, however, is based on the hypothesis
that phenotypic heterogeneity closely maps to genetic variation, which has
not been tested. Our study examines the impact of sub-phenotyping of a
well-characterized ASD sample on genetic homogeneity and the ability to
discover common genetic variants conferring liability to ASD.

Methods
Genome-wide genotypic data of 2576 families from the Simons Simplex
Collection (SSC) were analyzed in the overall sample and phenotypic
subgroups defined on the basis of diagnosis, IQ, and symptom profiles. We
conducted a family-based association study as well as estimating
heritability and evaluating allele scores for each phenotypic subgroup.

Results
Association analyses revealed no genome-wide significant association
signal. Sub-phenotyping did not increase power substantially. Moreover,
allele scores built from the most associated SNPs, based on the odds ratio
in the full sample, predicted case status in subsets of the sample equally
well and heritability estimates were very similar for all subgroups.

Conclusions
In genome-wide association analysis of the SSC sample, reducing
phenotypic heterogeneity had at most a modest impact on genetic homogeneity.
Our results are based on a relatively small sample, one with greater
homogeneity than the entire population; if they apply more broadly, they
imply that analysis of sub-phenotypes is not a productive path forward for
discovering genetic risk variants in ASD.},

It thus constitutes four scales measuring positive and negative syndromes, their differential, and general severity of illness. Study of 101 schizophrenics found the four scales to be normally distributed and supported their reliability and stability. Positive and negative scores were inversely correlated once their common association with general psychopathology was extracted, suggesting that they represent mutually exclusive constructs.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) {\textless}1.15).
METHODS: We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls).
RESULTS: We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes including PITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation and CUEDC2 previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0.23; P = 9 × 10-6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such as FOXP1 at 3p13, ATP2B2 at 3p25.3, and a 'neurodevelopmental hub' on chromosome 8p11.23.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such as EXT1, ASTN2, MACROD2, and HDAC4.},

Large-scale projects are now underway to catalog the complete phenome of a species, notably the mouse. With the increasing amount of phenotype information becoming available, a major challenge that biology faces today is the systematic analysis of this information and the translation of research results across species and into an improved understanding of human disease. The challenge is to integrate and combine phenotype descriptions within a species and to systematically relate them to phenotype descriptions in other species, in order to form a comprehensive understanding of the relations between those phenotypes and the genotypes involved in human disease. We distinguish between two major approaches for comparative phenotype analyses: the first relies on evolutionary relations to bridge the species gap, while the other approach compares phenotypes directly. In particular, the direct comparison of phenotypes relies heavily on the quality and coherence of phenotype and disease databases. We discuss major achievements and future challenges for these databases in light of their potential to contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human disease. In particular, we discuss how the use of ontologies and automated reasoning can significantly contribute to the analysis of phenotypes and demonstrate their potential for enabling translational research.},

In this paper, we show how our approach, using a combination of description logic and rule-based reasoning, enables high-level phenotypic abstractions to be inferred from subject-specific data.

	abstract = {The reconciliation between Mendelian inheritance of discrete traits and the genetically based correlation between relatives for quantitative traits was Fisher’s infinitesimal model of a large number of genetic variants, each with very small effects, whose causal effects could not be individually identified. The development of genome-wide genetic association studies (GWAS) raised the hope that it would be possible to identify single polymorphic variants with identifiable functional effects on complex traits. It soon became clear that, with larger and larger GWAS on more and more complex traits, most of the significant associations had such small effects, that identifying their individual functional effects was essentially hopeless. Polygenic risk scores that provide an overall estimate of the genetic propensity to a trait at the individual level have been developed using GWAS data. These provide useful identification of groups of individuals with substantially increased risks, which can lead to recommendations of medical treatments or behavioral modifications to reduce risks. However, each such claim will require extensive investigation to justify its practical application. The challenge now is to use limited genetic association studies to find individually identifiable variants of significant functional effect that can help to understand the molecular basis of complex diseases and traits, and so lead to improved disease prevention and treatment. This can best be achieved by 1) the study of rare variants, often chosen by careful candidate assessment, and 2) the careful choice of phenotypes, often extremes of a quantitative variable, or traits with relatively high heritability.},

It thus constitutes four scales measuring positive and negative syndromes, their differential, and general severity of illness. Study of 101 schizophrenics found the four scales to be normally distributed and supported their reliability and stability. Positive and negative scores were inversely correlated once their common association with general psychopathology was extracted, suggesting that they represent mutually exclusive constructs. Review of five studies involving the PANSS provided evidence of its criterion-related validity with antecedent, genealogical, and concurrent measures, its predictive validity, its drug sensitivity, and its utility for both typological and dimensional assessment.},

In essence, our model suggests that acute neuroinflammation during early fetal development may be relevant for the induction of psychopathological and neuropathological features shared by schizophrenia and autism, whereas postacute latent and persistent inflammation may contribute to schizophrenia- and autism-specific phenotypes, respectively.},

The symptoms of autism first appear during early life while schizophrenic symptoms do not typically appear until adolescence at the earliest. Efforts have been made to characterize the pattern of cognitive function in both disorders, and certain resemblances have become apparent such as deficits in abstract reasoning and the more complex aspects of memory and language. The present study provided a comparison of cognitive function between the two disorders. The autistic sample consisted of well-diagnosed individuals with high-functioning autism (IQ≥70). The schizophrenic sample was divided into four subgroups using Ward's method of cluster analysis. Participants received the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), the Halstead Category Test, the Trail Making test, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCST). The profile of the autism sample was compared with the four schizophrenia cluster profiles. The autism group resembled only one of the schizophrenia clusters, with both showing elevations on the WAIS-R Information and Block Design subtests and depressions on Comprehension and Digit Symbol. It was concluded that individuals with high-functioning autism have a cognitive profile that resembles that of an empirically derived subgroup of schizophrenia patients but that does not resemble profiles found in other schizophrenia subgroups. The pattern itself, marked by a relatively depressed score on the Comprehension subtest among the Verbal subtests and a relatively elevated score on Block Design among the Performance subtests, has been characterized in the past as a prototypic profile for high-functioning autism.},

Results showed that individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have higher levels of autistic symptoms compared to healthy controls [SMD: 1.39, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 1.68] and lower levels of autistic symptoms compared to individuals with autism (SMD: −1.27, 95\% CI: −1.77 to −0.76)., Conclusions: Current findings support that individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have higher autistic symptoms than healthy controls.

The medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) are essential regions for male sexual and aggressive behaviors, respectively. While key inhibitory inputs to the VMHvl and MPN have been identified, the extrahypothalamic excitatory inputs essential for social behaviors remain elusive. Here we identify estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1)-expressing cells in the posterior amygdala (PA) as a main source of excitatory inputs to the hypothalamus and key mediators for mating and fighting in male mice. We find two largely distinct PA subpopulations that differ in connectivity, gene expression, in vivo responses and social behavior relevance. MPN-projecting PAEsr1+ cells are activated during mating and are necessary and sufficient for male sexual behaviors, while VMHvl-projecting PAEsr1+ cells are excited during intermale aggression and promote attacks. These findings place the PA as a key node in both male aggression and reproduction circuits. Yamaguchi et al. identify a little-known amygdalar region, the posterior amygdala, as a key node in male mouse social behaviors. Two largely non-overlapping subpopulations in the posterior amygdala form parallel projections to distinct hypothalamic regions to regulate mating and fighting.},

METHODS: A cohort study of 217 individuals (median age 80, IQR 74-85 years; 62\% men) hospitalised with COVID-19, followed up for all-cause mortality, was conducted. Secondary outcomes included cognitive and physical function at discharge. C-reactive protein and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were used as measures of immune activity.
RESULTS: Cardinal COVID-19 symptoms (fever, dyspnoea, cough) were common but not universal. Inflammation on hospitalisation was lower in frail older adults. Fever, dyspnoea, delirium and inflammation were associated with mortality. Delirium at presentation was an independent risk factor for cognitive decline at discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may present without cardinal symptoms as well as implicate a possible role for age-related changes in immunity in mediating the relationship between frailty and mortality.},

There remains a challenge to determine the extent to which neurological abnormalities in COVID-19 are caused by SARS-Cov2 itself, the exaggerated cytokine response it triggers, and/or the resulting hypercoagulapathy and formation of blood clots in blood vessels throughout the body and the brain. In this article, we review the reports that address neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 who may present with acute neurological symptoms (e.g., stroke), even without typical respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Next, we discuss the different neurobiological processes and mechanisms that may underlie the link between SARS-Cov2 and COVID-19 in the brain, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, and muscles. Finally, we propose a basic "NeuroCovid" classification scheme that integrates these concepts and highlights some of the short-term challenges for the practice of neurology today and the long-term sequalae of COVID-19 such as depression, OCD, insomnia, cognitive decline, accelerated aging, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease in the future. In doing so, we intend to provide a basis from which to build on future hypotheses and investigations regarding SARS-Cov2 and the nervous system.},

As the respiratory tract connects to the brain without protection of the blood-brain barrier, SARS-CoV-2 might in the early invasive phase attack the cardiorespiratory centres located in the medulla/pons areas, giving rise to disturbances of respiration and cardiac problems. Furthermore, brainstem regions are at risk to lose their functional integrity. Therefore, long-term neurological as well as psychiatric symptomatology and eventual respective disorders cannot be excluded as evidenced from influenza-A triggered post-encephalitic Parkinsonism and HIV-1 triggered AIDS-dementia complex. From the available evidences for coronavirus-induced brain pathology, this review concludes a number of unmet needs for further research strategies like human postmortem brain analyses. SARS-CoV-2 mirroring experimental animal brain studies, characterization of time-dependent and region-dependent spreading behaviours of coronaviruses, enlightening of pathological mechanisms after coronavirus infection using long-term animal models and clinical observations of patients having had COVID-19 infection are calling to develop both protective strategies and drug discoveries to avoid early and late coronavirus-induced functional brain disturbances, symptoms and eventually disorders. To fight SARS-CoV-2, it is an urgent need to enforce clinical, molecular biological, neurochemical and genetic research including brain-related studies on a worldwide harmonized basis.},

	abstract = {Patients with cardiovascular disease and, namely, heart failure are more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and have a more severe clinical course once infected. Heart failure and myocardial damage, shown by increased troponin plasma levels, occur in at least 10\% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with higher percentages, 25\% to 35\% or more, when patients critically ill or with concomitant cardiac disease are considered. Myocardial injury may be elicited by multiple mechanisms, including those occurring with all severe infections, such as fever, tachycardia, adrenergic stimulation, as well as those caused by an exaggerated inflammatory response, endotheliitis and, in some cases, myocarditis that have been shown in patients with COVID-19. A key role may be that of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects human cells binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of angiotensin II into angiotensin 1–7, which has vasodilating and anti-inflammatory effects. Virus-mediated down-regulation of ACE2 may increase angiotensin II stimulation and contribute to the deleterious hyper-inflammatory reaction of COVID-19. On the other hand, ACE2 may be up-regulated in patients with cardiac disease and treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. ACE2 up-regulation may increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 but may be also protective vs. angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and inflammatory activation. Recent data show the lack of untoward effects of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for COVID-19 infection and severity. Prospective trials are needed to ascertain whether these drugs may have protective effects.},

However, causal inference is undermined if genetic variants used to instrument a risk factor also influence alternative disease-pathways (horizontal pleiotropy). Here we report how the ‘no horizontal pleiotropy assumption’ is strengthened when proteins are the risk factors of interest. Proteins are typically the proximal effectors of biological processes encoded in the genome. Moreover, proteins are the targets of most medicines, so MR studies of drug targets are becoming a fundamental tool in drug development. To enable such studies, we introduce a mathematical framework that contrasts MR analysis of proteins with that of risk factors located more distally in the causal chain from gene to disease. We illustrate key model decisions and introduce an analytical framework for maximising power and evaluating the robustness of analyses.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that naturally occurring genetic variation contributes to the risk of astigmatism. The purpose of this investigation was to identify genetic markers associated with corneal and refractive astigmatism in a large-scale European ancestry cohort (UK Biobank) who underwent keratometry and autorefraction at an assessment centre. Genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism were performed in individuals of European ancestry (N = 86,335 and 88,005 respectively), with the mean corneal astigmatism or refractive astigmatism in fellow eyes analysed as a quantitative trait (dependent variable). Genetic correlation between the two traits was calculated using LD Score regression. Gene-based and gene-set tests were carried out using MAGMA. Single marker-based association tests for corneal astigmatism identified four genome-wide significant loci (P {\textless} 5 × 10-8) near the genes ZC3H11B (1q41), LINC00340 (6p22.3), HERC2/OCA2 (15q13.1) and NPLOC4/TSPAN10 (17q25.3). Three of these loci also demonstrated genome-wide significant association with refractive astigmatism: LINC00340, HERC2/OCA2 and NPLOC4/TSPAN10. The genetic correlation between corneal and refractive astigmatism was 0.85 (standard error = 0.068, P = 1.37 × 10-35). Here, we have undertaken the largest genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism to date and identified four novel loci for corneal astigmatism, two of which were also novel loci for refractive astigmatism. These loci have previously demonstrated association with axial length (ZC3H11B), myopia (NPLOC4), spherical equivalent refractive error (LINC00340) and eye colour (HERC2). The shared role of these novel candidate genes for astigmatism lends further support to the shared genetic susceptibility of myopia and astigmatism.},

METHODS: This analysis included a subsample of 107,452 participants of the UK Biobank study who underwent an enhanced ophthalmic examination including autorefractor keratometry (Tomey RC 5000, Tomey Corp., Nagoya, Japan). Participants were recruited from across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, and all were between 40 to 69 years. After quality control and applying relevant exclusions, data on corneal astigmatism on 83,751 participants were included for analysis. Potential associations were tested through univariable regression and significant parameters carried forward for multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: In univariable analysis, the characteristics significantly associated with higher corneal astigmatism (P{\textless}0.001), by order of magnitude were, female gender, white ethnicity, lighter skin colour, use of UV protection, lower alcohol intake, lower corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (ccIOP), older age at completion of education, younger age, higher Townsend deprivation index, lower height and lower systolic blood pressure. After inclusion in the multivariable analysis, gender, skin colour, alcohol intake, age at completion of full-time education, ccIOP, age and Townsend deprivation score remained significant (all P{\textless}0.001). Increased corneal astigmatism was also found to be significantly associated with amblyopia or strabismus.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirms previous associations with astigmatism such as younger age and female gender, and identified novel risk factors including lighter skin colour, lower alcohol intake, later age having completed full time education later, lower ccIOP and higher Townsend deprivation index.

PARTICIPANTS: UK Biobank is a large, multisite, prospective cohort study. Extensive lifestyle and health questionnaires, a range of physical measures and collection of biological specimens are collected. The scope of UK Biobank was extended midway through data collection to include assessments of other measures of health, including eyes and vision. The eye assessment at baseline included questionnaires detailing past ophthalmic and family history, measurement of visual acuity, refractive error and keratometry, intraocular pressure (IOP), corneal biomechanics, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula and a disc-macula fundus photograph. Since recruitment, UK Biobank has collected accelerometer data and begun multimodal imaging data (including brain, heart and abdominal MRI) in 100 000 participants. Dense genotypic data and a panel of 20 biochemistry measures are available, and linkage to medical health records for the full cohort has begun.
FINDINGS TO DATE: A total of 502 665 people aged between 40 and 69 were recruited to participate in UK Biobank. Of these, 117 175 took part in baseline assessment of vision, IOP, refraction and keratometry. A subgroup of 67 321 underwent OCT and retinal photography. The introduction of eye and vision measures in UK Biobank was accompanied by intensive training, support and a data monitoring quality control process.
FUTURE PLANS: UK Biobank is one of the largest prospective cohorts worldwide with extensive data on ophthalmic diseases and conditions. Data collection is an ongoing process and a repeat of the baseline assessment including the questionnaires, measurements and sample collection will be performed in subsets of 25 000 participants every 2-3 years. The depth and breadth of this dataset, coupled with its open-access policy, will create a powerful resource for all researchers to investigate the eye diseases in later life.},

We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm—and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it—as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to “ban” p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

To investigate why, this study applies a multivariable Mendelian randomization of intelligence and education. For those without college degrees, older age of finishing school associates with a decreased likelihood of schizophrenia—independent of intelligence—and, hence, may be entangled with the health inequalities reflecting differences in education. A different picture is observed for schooling years inclusive of college: more years of schooling increases the likelihood of schizophrenia, whereas higher intelligence distinctly and independently decreases it. This implies the pleiotropy between years of schooling and schizophrenia is horizontal and likely confounded by a third trait influencing education. A multivariable Mendelian randomization of schooling years and bipolar disorder reveals that the increased risk of schizophrenia conferred by more schooling years is an artefact of bipolar disorder – not education.},

	abstract = {Finding individual-level data for adequately-powered Mendelian randomization analyses may be problematic. As publicly-available summarized data on genetic associations with disease outcomes from large consortia are becoming more abundant, use of published data is an attractive analysis strategy for obtaining precise estimates of the causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. We detail the necessary steps for conducting Mendelian randomization investigations using published data, and present novel statistical methods for combining data on the associations of multiple (correlated or uncorrelated) genetic variants with the risk factor and outcome into a single causal effect estimate. A two-sample analysis strategy may be employed, in which evidence on the gene-risk factor and gene-outcome associations are taken from different data sources. These approaches allow the efficient identification of risk factors that are suitable targets for clinical intervention from published data, although the ability to assess the assumptions necessary for causal inference is diminished. Methods and guidance are illustrated using the example of the causal effect of serum calcium levels on fasting glucose concentrations. The estimated causal effect of a 1 standard deviation (0.13 mmol/L) increase in calcium levels on fasting glucose (mM) using a single lead variant from the CASR gene region is 0.044 (95 \% credible interval −0.002, 0.100). In contrast, using our method to account for the correlation between variants, the corresponding estimate using 17 genetic variants is 0.022 (95 \% credible interval 0.009, 0.035), a more clearly positive causal effect.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Religious coping arguably prevents negative health outcomes for stressed persons. This study examined the moderating role of religious coping (positive, negative, and combined) in the connection of care recipient functional status with diurnal salivary cortisol patterns among dementia family caregivers.
METHODS: Thirty African American (AA) female dementia caregivers and 48 AA noncaregivers completed the Religious Coping (RCOPE) scale, the Activities of Daily Living scale, and the Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) and collected five saliva samples daily (at awakening, 9 A.M., 12 P.M., 5 P.M., and 9 P.M.) for 2 straight days.
RESULTS: Hierarchical regression tests with mean diurnal cortisol slope as the outcome illustrated surprisingly that higher combined and positive (but not negative) RCOPE scores were associated with increasingly flatter or worse cortisol slope scores for caregivers (but not noncaregivers). Of note, the RCOPE by RMBPC interaction was significant. Among caregivers who reported higher RMBPC scores, higher combined and positive (but not negative) RCOPE scores were unexpectedly associated with increasingly flatter cortisol slopes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results extend current findings by showing that being AA, a caregiver, and high in positive religious coping may predict increased daily stress responses, mainly for those with higher patient behavioral problems. Because religious coping is a central coping strategy for AA caregivers, it is vital that epidemiologic assessments of religious coping in health and aging as well as tailored interventions focus on the unique reasons for this disparity.},

	abstract = {Objective
Our goal is to create an ontology that will allow data integration and reasoning with subject data to classify subjects, and based on this classification, to infer new knowledge on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). We take a first step toward this goal by extending an existing autism ontology to allow automatic inference of ASD phenotypes and Diagnostic \& Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria based on subjects’ Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessment data.
Materials and methods
Knowledge regarding diagnostic instruments, ASD phenotypes and risk factors was added to augment an existing autism ontology via Ontology Web Language class definitions and semantic web rules. We developed a custom Protégé plugin for enumerating combinatorial OWL axioms to support the many-to-many relations of ADI-R items to diagnostic categories in the DSM. We utilized a reasoner to infer whether 2642 subjects, whose data was obtained from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, meet DSM-IV-TR (DSM-IV) and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria based on their ADI-R data.
Results
We extended the ontology by adding 443 classes and 632 rules that represent phenotypes, along with their synonyms, environmental risk factors, and frequency of comorbidities. Applying the rules on the data set showed that the method produced accurate results: the true positive and true negative rates for inferring autistic disorder diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria were 1 and 0.065, respectively; the true positive rate for inferring ASD based on DSM-5 criteria was 0.94.
Discussion
The ontology allows automatic inference of subjects’ disease phenotypes and diagnosis with high accuracy.
Conclusion
The ontology may benefit future studies by serving as a knowledge base for ASD. In addition, by adding knowledge of related NDDs, commonalities and differences in manifestations and risk factors could be automatically inferred, contributing to the understanding of ASD pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Objective
Mendelian randomization is a popular technique for assessing and estimating the causal effects of risk factors. If genetic variants which are instrumental variables for a risk factor are shown to be additionally associated with a disease outcome, then the risk factor is a cause of the disease. However, in many cases, the instrumental variable assumptions are not plausible, or are in doubt. In this paper, we provide a theoretical classification of scenarios in which a causal conclusion is justified or not justified, and discuss the interpretation of causal effect estimates.

Results
A list of guidelines based on the ‘Bradford Hill criteria’ for judging the plausibility of a causal finding from an applied Mendelian randomization study is provided. We also give a framework for performing and interpreting investigations performed in the style of Mendelian randomization, but where the choice of genetic variants is statistically, rather than biologically motivated. Such analyses should not be assigned the same evidential weight as a Mendelian randomization investigation.

Conclusion
We discuss the role of such investigations (in the style of Mendelian randomization), and what they add to our understanding of potential causal mechanisms. If the genetic variants are selected solely according to statistical criteria, and the biological roles of genetic variants are not investigated, this may be little more than what can be learned from a well-designed classical observational study.},

Several high-profile situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different findings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable (IV) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modifiable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of IV analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies. The method has been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization’, and can be considered as analogous to randomized controlled trials. This paper outlines Mendelian randomization, draws parallels with IV methods, provides examples of implementation of the approach and discusses limitations of the approach and some methods for dealing with these.

Disruption of the biological rhythm was identified, even in drug-naïve BD patients and independently of mood status. Daily profiles of melatonin levels and cortisol indicated a delayed phase. Depression was more frequently associated with circadian alterations than euthymia. Few studies evaluated mania, demonstrating irregular rhythms. Evening type was more common in BD adults. Studies about the influence of chronotype on depressive symptoms showed conflicting results. Only one investigation observed the influences of chronotype in mania, revealing no significant association. Effects of psychoeducation and lithium on rhythm in BD patients were poorly studied, demonstrating no improvement of rhythm parameters. Studies about genetics are incipient. In conclusion, disruption in circadian rhythm and eveningness are common in BD. Prospective research evaluating the impact of circadian disruption on mood symptoms, metabolism, seasonality, the influence of age and the effects of mood stabilizers are needed.},

Sleep and wake times show a near-Gaussian distribution in a given population, with extreme early types waking up when extreme late types fall asleep. This distribution is predominantly based on differences in an individuals' circadian clock. The relationship between the circadian system and different "chronotypes" is formally and genetically well established in experimental studies in organisms ranging from unicells to mammals. To investigate the epidemiology of the human circadian clock, we developed a simple questionnaire (Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, MCTQ) to assess chronotype. So far, more than 55,000 people have completed the MCTQ, which has been validated with respect to the Horne-Østberg morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ), objective measures of activity and rest (sleep-logs and actimetry), and physiological parameters. As a result of this large survey, we established an algorithm which optimises chronotype assessment by incorporating the information on timing of sleep and wakefulness for both work and free days. The timing and duration of sleep are generally independent. However, when the two are analysed separately for work and free days, sleep duration strongly depends on chronotype. In addition, chronotype is both age- and sex-dependent.},

Using genetic mutation of 'clock genes', robust animal models of mania and depression have been developed that elucidate key aspects of circadian rhythms and the circadian clock-mood connection. However, translation of this knowledge into humans remains incomplete. In recent years, very large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted and the genetic underpinnings of BD are beginning to emerge. However, these genetic studies in BD do not match well with the evidence from animal studies that implicate the circadian clock in mood regulation. Even larger GWAS have been conducted for circadian phenotypes including chronotype, rhythm amplitude, sleep duration, and insomnia. These studies have identified a diverse set of associated genes, including a minority with previously well-characterized functions in the circadian clock. Taken together, the data from recent GWAS of BD and circadian phenotypes indicate that the genetic organization of the circadian clock, both in health and in BD is complex. The findings from GWAS elucidate potentially novel circadian mechanism that may be partly distinct from those identified in animal models. Pleiotropy, epistasis and nongenetic factors may play important roles in regulating circadian rhythms, some of which may underlie circadian rhythm disturbances in BD.},

	abstract = {Background
Mendelian randomization (MR) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions.

Methods
Here, a new method - the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk.

Results
The MBE presented less bias and lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared with the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia.

Conclusions
The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in sensitivity analyses.},

This problem is likely to be general to other mediation-based approaches. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it can be performed using only summary level data from genome-wide association studies; second, it is less susceptible to bias in the presence of measurement error or unmeasured confounding. We apply the method to infer the causal direction between DNA methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate that, in general, DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms, and by horizontal pleiotropy. We emphasise that, where possible, implementing MR and appropriate sensitivity analyses alongside other approaches such as CIT is important to triangulate reliable conclusions about causality.},

In the epidemiologic literature, discussion of whether the assumptions underlying IV analyses hold is often limited to only certain assumptions and even then, arguments are mostly made using subject matter knowledge. To complement subject matter knowledge, there exist a variety of falsification strategies and other tools for weighing the plausibility of the assumptions underlying IV analyses.
Recent Findings: There are many tools that can refute the IV assumptions or help estimate the magnitude or direction of possible bias if the conditions do not hold perfectly. Many of these tools, including both recently developed strategies and strategies described decades ago, are underused or only used in specific applications of IV methods in epidemiology.
Summary: Although estimating causal effects with IV analyses relies on unverifiable assumptions, the assumptions can sometimes be refuted. We suggest that the epidemiologists using IV analyses employ all the falsification strategies that apply to their research question in order to avoid settings that demonstrably violate a core condition for valid inference.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic instrumental variables to obtain causal inferences from observational data. Two recent developments for combining information on multiple uncorrelated instrumental variables (IVs) into a single causal estimate are as follows: (i) allele scores, in which individual-level data on the IVs are aggregated into a univariate score, which is used as a single IV, and (ii) a summary statistic method, in which causal estimates calculated from each IV using summarized data are combined in an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. To avoid bias from weak instruments, unweighted and externally weighted allele scores have been recommended. Here, we propose equivalent approaches using summarized data and also provide extensions of the methods for use with correlated IVs. We investigate the impact of different choices of weights on the bias and precision of estimates in simulation studies. We show that allele score estimates can be reproduced using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor and the outcome. Estimates from the summary statistic method using external weights are biased towards the null when the weights are imprecisely estimated; in contrast, allele score estimates are unbiased. With equal or external weights, both methods provide appropriate tests of the null hypothesis of no causal effect even with large numbers of potentially weak instruments. We illustrate these methods using summarized data on the causal effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary heart disease risk. It is shown that a more precise causal estimate can be obtained using multiple genetic variants from a single gene region, even if the variants are correlated.},

We demonstrate how such coefficients from multiple variants can be combined in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome. The bias and efficiency of estimates based on summarized data are compared to those based on individual-level data in simulation studies. We investigate the impact of gene-gene interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and 'weak instruments' on these estimates. Both an inverse-variance weighted average of variant-specific associations and a likelihood-based approach for summarized data give similar estimates and precision to the two-stage least squares method for individual-level data, even when there are gene-gene interactions. However, these summarized data methods overstate precision when variants are in linkage disequilibrium. If the P-value in a linear regression of the risk factor for each variant is less than 1×10⁻⁵, then weak instrument bias will be small. We use these methods to estimate the causal association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on coronary artery disease using published data on five genetic variants. A 30\% reduction in LDL-C is estimated to reduce coronary artery disease risk by 67\% (95\% CI: 54\% to 76\%). We conclude that Mendelian randomization investigations using summarized data from uncorrelated variants are similarly efficient to those using individual-level data, although the necessary assumptions cannot be so fully assessed.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Mendelian randomization refers to an analytic approach to assess the causality of an observed association between a modifiable exposure or risk factor and a clinically relevant outcome. It presents a valuable tool, especially when randomized controlled trials to examine causality are not feasible and observational studies provide biased associations because of confounding or reverse causality. These issues are addressed by using genetic variants as instrumental variables for the tested exposure: the alleles of this exposure–associated genetic variant are randomly allocated and not subject to reverse causation. This, together with the wide availability of published genetic associations to screen for suitable genetic instrumental variables make Mendelian randomization a time- and cost-efficient approach and contribute to its increasing popularity for assessing and screening for potentially causal associations. An observed association between the genetic instrumental variable and the outcome supports the hypothesis that the exposure in question is causally related to the outcome. This review provides an overview of the Mendelian randomization method, addresses assumptions and implications, and includes illustrative examples. We also discuss special issues in nephrology, such as inverse risk factor associations in advanced disease, and outline opportunities to design Mendelian randomization studies around kidney function and disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The archive presents several challenges related to aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements, feature heterogeneity and salience, and health analytics. Using 7,614 imaging, clinical, and phenotypic features of 9,914 subjects we performed deep computed phenotyping using unsupervised clustering and derived two distinct sub-cohorts. Using parametric and nonparametric tests, we determined the top 20 most salient features contributing to the cluster separation. Our approach generated decision rules to predict the presence and progression of depression or other mental illnesses by jointly representing and modeling the significant clinical and demographic variables along with the derived salient neuroimaging features. We reported consistency and reliability measures of the derived computed phenotypes and the top salient imaging biomarkers that contributed to the unsupervised clustering. This clinical decision support system identified and utilized holistically the most critical biomarkers for predicting mental health, e.g., depression. External validation of this technique on different populations may lead to reducing healthcare expenses and improving the processes of diagnosis, forecasting, and tracking of normal and pathological aging.},

	title = {Simultaneous assessment of circadian rhythms and sleep in mice using passive infrared sensors: a user guide},
	volume = {In Press},
	abstract = {The 24h cycle of activity and sleep provides perhaps the most familiar example of circadian rhythms. In mammals, circadian activity rhythms are generated by a master biological clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). This clock is synchronized (entrained) to the external light environment via light input from retinal photoreceptors. However, sleep is not a simple circadian output and is also regulated by a homeostatic process whereby extended wakefulness increases the need for subsequent sleep. As such, the amount and distribution of sleep depends upon the interaction between both circadian and homeostatic processes. The study of circadian activity and sleep is not only confined to these specialised fields. Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption is common in many conditions, ranging from neurological and metabolic disorders to aging. Such disruption is associated with a range of negative consequences including cognitive impairment, mood disorders, as well as immune and metabolic dysfunction. As circadian activity and sleep are hallmarks of normal healthy physiology, they also provide valuable welfare indicators. However traditional methods for the monitoring of circadian rhythms and sleep in mice can require separate specialised resources as well as significant expertise. Here we outline a low-cost, non-invasive and open source method for the simultaneous assessment of circadian activity and sleep in mice. This protocol describes both the assembly of the hardware used and the capture and analysis of data without the need for expertise in electronics or data processing.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To describe corneal astigmatism in the UK Biobank population and to look for associations with other biometric variables and socio-demographic factors.

Methods
This analysis included a subsample of 107,452 participants of the UK Biobank study who underwent an enhanced ophthalmic examination including autorefractor keratometry (Tomey RC 5000, Tomey Corp., Nagoya, Japan). Participants were recruited from across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, and all were between 40 to 69 years. After quality control and applying relevant exclusions, data on corneal astigmatism on 83,751 participants were included for analysis. Potential associations were tested through univariable regression and significant parameters carried forward for multivariable analysis.

Results
In univariable analysis, the characteristics significantly associated with higher corneal astigmatism (P{\textless}0.001), by order of magnitude were, female gender, white ethnicity, lighter skin colour, use of UV protection, lower alcohol intake, lower corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (ccIOP), older age at completion of education, younger age, higher Townsend deprivation index, lower height and lower systolic blood pressure. After inclusion in the multivariable analysis, gender, skin colour, alcohol intake, age at completion of full-time education, ccIOP, age and Townsend deprivation score remained significant (all P{\textless}0.001). Increased corneal astigmatism was also found to be significantly associated with amblyopia or strabismus.

Conclusions
This analysis confirms previous associations with astigmatism such as younger age and female gender, and identified novel risk factors including lighter skin colour, lower alcohol intake, later age having completed full time education later, lower ccIOP and higher Townsend deprivation index. Further research is needed to investigate these novel associations.},

	abstract = {Retinal photoreceptors entrain the circadian system to the solar day. This photic resetting involves cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated upregulation of Per genes within individual cells of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Our detailed understanding of this pathway is poor, and it remains unclear why entrainment to a new time zone takes several days. By analyzing the light-regulated transcriptome of the SCN, we have identified a key role for salt inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in clock re-setting. An entrainment stimulus causes CRTC1 to coactivate CREB, inducing the expression of Per1 and Sik1. SIK1 then inhibits further shifts of the clock by phosphorylation and deactivation of CRTC1. Knockdown of Sik1 within the SCN results in increased behavioral phase shifts and rapid re-entrainment following experimental jet lag. Thus SIK1 provides negative feedback, acting to suppress the effects of light on the clock. This pathway provides a potential target for the regulation of circadian rhythms.},

	abstract = {Background: Disruption of rhythms in activity and rest occur in many diseases, and provide an important indicator of healthy physiology and behaviour. However, outside the field of sleep and circadian rhythm research, these rhythmic processes are rarely measured due to the requirement for specialised resources and expertise. Until recently, the primary approach to measuring activity in laboratory rodents has been based on voluntary running wheel activity. By contrast, measuring sleep requires the use of electroencephalography (EEG), which involves invasive surgical procedures and time-consuming data analysis., 
Methods: Here we describe a simple, non-invasive system to measure home cage activity in mice based upon passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors. Careful calibration of this system will allow users to simultaneously assess sleep status in mice. The use of open-source tools and simple sensors keeps the cost and the size of data-files down, in order to increase ease of use and uptake., 
Results: In addition to providing accurate data on circadian activity parameters, here we show that extended immobility of {\textgreater}40 seconds provides a reliable indicator of sleep, correlating well with EEG-defined sleep (Pearson’s r {\textgreater}0.95, 4 mice). , 
Conclusions: Whilst any detailed analysis of sleep patterns in mice will require EEG, behaviourally-defined sleep provides a valuable non-invasive means of simultaneously phenotyping both circadian rhythms and sleep. Whilst previous approaches have relied upon analysis of video data, here we show that simple motion sensors provide a cheap and effective alternative, enabling real-time analysis and longitudinal studies extending over weeks or even months. The data files produced are small, enabling easy deposition and sharing. We have named this system COMPASS - Continuous Open Mouse Phenotyping of Activity and Sleep Status. This simple approach is of particular value in phenotyping screens as well as providing an ideal tool to assess activity and rest cycles for non-specialists.},

These endogenous time keeping mechanisms are called circadian clocks. The main function of these circadian clocks is to drive overt circadian rhythms in the physiology of the organisms to ensure that main physiological functions are in synchrony with the external environment. Disruption of circadian rhythms caused by genetic or environmental factors has long-term consequences for metabolic health. Of relevance, host circadian rhythmicity and lipid metabolism are increasingly recognized to cross-regulate and the circadian clock-lipid metabolism interplay may involve in the development of obesity. Multiple systemic and molecular mechanisms, such as hormones (i.e., melatonin, leptin, and glucocorticoid), the gut microbiome, and energy metabolism, link the circadian clock and lipid metabolism, and predictably, the deregulation of circadian clock-lipid metabolism interplay can increase the risk of obesity, which in turn may exacerbate circadian disorganization. Feeding time and dietary nutrients are two of key environmental Zeitgebers affecting the circadian rhythm-lipid metabolism interplay and the influencing mechanisms in obesity development are highlighted in this review. Together, the characterization of the clock machinery in lipid metabolism aimed at producing a healthy circadian lifestyle may improve obesity care.},

Preclinical or clinical studies showed recently the mechanisms involved in regulating the cellular activity, its role in aging and circadian disturbances and impact on degenerative diseases. Melatonin proved to have an anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and powerful antioxidant effect by subtle mechanisms in mitochondrial metabolic pathways. This overview includes recent and relevant literature data related to the impact of endogenous and exogeneous melatonin on the prevention of cancer progression and treatment of various degenerative diseases.

	abstract = {The basic helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor (CLOCK, Circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput) was discovered in 1994 as a circadian clock. Soon after its discovery, the circadian clock, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (ARNTL, also call BMAL1), was shown to regulate adiposity and body weight by controlling on the brain hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Farther, circadian clock genes were determined to exert several of lipid metabolic and diabetes effects, overall indicating that CLOCK and BMAL1 act as a central master circadian clock. A master circadian clock acts through the neurons and hormones, with expression in the intestine, liver, kidney, lung, heart, SCN of brain, and other various cell types of the organization. Among circadian clock genes, numerous metabolic syndromes are the most important in the regulation of food intake (via regulation of circadian clock genes or clock-controlled genes in peripheral tissue), which lead to a variation in plasma phospholipids and tissue phospholipids. Circadian clock genes affect the regulation of transporters and proteins included in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism. These genes have recently received increasing recognition because a pharmacological target of circadian clock genes may be of therapeutic worth to make better resistance against insulin, diabetes, obesity, metabolism syndrome, atherosclerosis, and brain diseases. In this book chapter, we focus on the regulation of circadian clock and summarize its phospholipid effect as well as discuss the chemical, physiology, and molecular value of circadian clock pathway regulation for the treatment of plasma lipids and atherosclerosis.},

The molecular mechanism underlying the circadian clock has been well characterized. However, how internal circadian clocks are entrained with regular daily light/dark cycles remains unclear. By collecting and analyzing indirect calorimetry (IC) data from more than 2000 wild-type mice available from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), we show that the onset time and peak phase of activity and food intake rhythms are reliable parameters for screening defects of circadian misalignment. We developed a machine learning algorithm to quantify these two parameters in our misalignment screen (SyncScreener) with existing datasets and used it to screen 750 mutant mouse lines from five IMPC phenotyping centres. Mutants of five genes (Slc7a11, Rhbdl1, Spop, Ctc1 and Oxtr) were found to be associated with altered patterns of activity or food intake. By further studying the Slc7a11tm1a/tm1a mice, we confirmed its advanced activity phase phenotype in response to a simulated jetlag and skeleton photoperiod stimuli. Disruption of Slc7a11 affected the intercellular communication in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, suggesting a defect in synchronization of clock neurons.

RESULTS: To obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mRNA expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62 839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. Indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index tau, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15{\textless} tau{\textless}0.85 were found to constitute {\textgreater}50\% of all expression patterns. We developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the I(B) tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12-I(B) tissues in which it shows low expression. The 85 dominant midrange patterns with I(B)=2-11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. Our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. Such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. These findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.

However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens. We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants. We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis. The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators. Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large. Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered. These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies.},

	abstract = {Pleiotropy, the phenomenon of a single genetic variant influencing multiple traits, is likely widespread in the human genome. If pleiotropy arises because the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) influences one trait, which in turn influences another (‘vertical pleiotropy’), then Mendelian randomization (MR) can be used to estimate the causal influence between the traits. Of prime focus among the many limitations to MR is the unprovable assumption that apparent pleiotropic associations are mediated by the exposure (i.e. reflect vertical pleiotropy), and do not arise due to SNPs influencing the two traits through independent pathways (‘horizontal pleiotropy’). The burgeoning treasure trove of genetic associations yielded through genome wide association studies makes for a tantalizing prospect of phenome-wide causal inference. Recent years have seen substantial attention devoted to the problem of horizontal pleiotropy, and in this review we outline how newly developed methods can be used together to improve the reliability of MR.},

	abstract = {Imputing genotypes from reference panels created by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides a cost-effective strategy for augmenting the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) content of genome-wide arrays. The UK10K Cohorts project has generated a data set of 3,781 whole genomes sequenced at low depth (average 7x), aiming to exhaustively characterize genetic variation down to 0.1\% minor allele frequency in the British population. Here we demonstrate the value of this resource for improving imputation accuracy at rare and low-frequency variants in both a UK and an Italian population. We show that large increases in imputation accuracy can be achieved by re-phasing WGS reference panels after initial genotype calling. We also present a method for combining WGS panels to improve variant coverage and downstream imputation accuracy, which we illustrate by integrating 7,562 WGS haplotypes from the UK10K project with 2,184 haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project. Finally, we introduce a novel approximation that maintains speed without sacrificing imputation accuracy for rare variants.},

	doi = {10.1534/g3.111.001198},
	abstract = {Genotype imputation is a statistical technique that is often used to increase the power and resolution of genetic association studies. Imputation methods work by using haplotype patterns in a reference panel to predict unobserved genotypes in a study dataset, and a number of approaches have been proposed for choosing subsets of reference haplotypes that will maximize accuracy in a given study population. These panel selection strategies become harder to apply and interpret as sequencing efforts like the 1000 Genomes Project produce larger and more diverse reference sets, which led us to develop an alternative framework. Our approach is built around a new approximation that uses local sequence similarity to choose a custom reference panel for each study haplotype in each region of the genome. This approximation makes it computationally efficient to use all available reference haplotypes, which allows us to bypass the panel selection step and to improve accuracy at low-frequency variants by capturing unexpected allele sharing among populations. Using data from HapMap 3, we show that our framework produces accurate results in a wide range of human populations. We also use data from the Malaria Genetic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN) to provide recommendations for imputation-based studies in Africa. We demonstrate that our approximation improves efficiency in large, sequence-based reference panels, and we discuss general computational strategies for modern reference datasets. Genome-wide association studies will soon be able to harness the power of thousands of reference genomes, and our work provides a practical way for investigators to use this rich information. New methodology from this study is implemented in the IMPUTE2 software package.},

We report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for EA that extends our earlier discovery sample, of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We now identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioral phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because EA is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric disease.},

Children ({\textless} 20 years) in the high myopia group exhibited the poorest PSQI scores (P {\textless} 0.01), while the adults showed no such correlations. Subscales of PSQI and HADS in children disclosed that the high myopia groups had the shortest sleep duration (P {\textless} 0.01), worst subjective sleep scores (P {\textless} 0.001) and latest bedtime (P {\textless} 0.05). Regression analyses in children significantly correlated myopic errors with PSQI (P {\textless} 0.05), sleep duration (P {\textless} 0.01) and bedtime (P {\textless} 0.01). Sleep efficacy (P {\textless} 0.05) and daytime dysfunction (P {\textless} 0.05) were significantly better in contact-lens users compared to the respective non-user groups across all participants.

	abstract = {Background: Keratoconus, a non-inflammatory corneal ectasia, is reported to have bilateral involvement in over 90\% of patients. The purpose of this study was to quantify the extent of asymmetry of disease at presentation to a regional corneal clinic., Methods: Eighty three patients diagnosed at presentation, using a combination of videokeratography, slit lamp examination, and refractive findings were retrospectively selected. On this basis, 73 patients were designated as having evidence of keratoconus in both eyes. In order to quantify the degree of asymmetry between fellow eyes in these bilateral patients, intraclass correlation was calculated for best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) and for 13 different topographical indices generated using videokeratography. In order to examine the link between each index and visual function, the intrapatient differences in each index were compared to the intrapatient differences in BSCVA using Pearson’s correlation., Results: BSCVA showed a high degree of asymmetry between fellow eyes with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.006. With the exception of area analysed, all of the topographical indices also showed disparity between paired eyes (r = 0.01 to r = 0.25). Pearson’s analysis found that the intrapatient differences in the standard deviation of the power (SDP), average corneal power (ACP), central corneal power (K), as well as the composite keratoconus prediction index (KPI) inversely correlated with the intrapatient differences in best spectacle corrected acuity (r = −0.76,−0.75,−0.69, and −0.73 respectively)., Conclusions: This study demonstrates, quantitatively, the asymmetry of disease found in patients at the point of initial diagnosis of keratoconus. It also suggests that increases in indices which reflect various aspects of corneal power as well as the composite index KPI correlate with a decrease in BSCVA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses.
DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision.
RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).
METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables.
RESULTS: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.
CONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

	doi = {10.1093/ije/dyw220},
	abstract = {Background: : MR-Egger regression has recently been proposed as a method for Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses incorporating summary data estimates of causal effect from multiple individual variants, which is robust to invalid instruments. It can be used to test for directional pleiotropy and provides an estimate of the causal effect adjusted for its presence. MR-Egger regression provides a useful additional sensitivity analysis to the standard inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach that assumes all variants are valid instruments. Both methods use weights that consider the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-exposure associations to be known, rather than estimated. We call this the `NO Measurement Error' (NOME) assumption. Causal effect estimates from the IVW approach exhibit weak instrument bias whenever the genetic variants utilized violate the NOME assumption, which can be reliably measured using the F-statistic. The effect of NOME violation on MR-Egger regression has yet to be studied.
Methods: An adaptation of the I2 statistic from the field of meta-analysis is proposed to quantify the strength of NOME violation for MR-Egger. It lies between 0 and 1, and indicates the expected relative bias (or dilution) of the MR-Egger causal estimate in the two-sample MR context. We call it IGX2 . The method of simulation extrapolation is also explored to counteract the dilution. Their joint utility is evaluated using simulated data and applied to a real MR example.
Results: In simulated two-sample MR analyses we show that, when a causal effect exists, the MR-Egger estimate of causal effect is biased towards the null when NOME is violated, and the stronger the violation (as indicated by lower values of IGX2 ), the stronger the dilution. When additionally all genetic variants are valid instruments, the type I error rate of the MR-Egger test for pleiotropy is inflated and the causal effect underestimated. Simulation extrapolation is shown to substantially mitigate these adverse effects. We demonstrate our proposed approach for a two-sample summary data MR analysis to estimate the causal effect of low-density lipoprotein on heart disease risk. A high value of IGX2 close to 1 indicates that dilution does not materially affect the standard MR-Egger analyses for these data.
Conclusions: : Care must be taken to assess the NOME assumption via the IGX2 statistic before implementing standard MR-Egger regression in the two-sample summary data context. If IGX2 is sufficiently low (less than 90\%), inferences from the method should be interpreted with caution and adjustment methods considered.},

However, obtaining reliable results from a Mendelian randomization investigation remains problematic, as the conventional inverse-variance weighted method only gives consistent estimates if all of the genetic variants in the analysis are valid instrumental variables. We present a novel weighted median estimator for combining data on multiple genetic variants into a single causal estimate. This estimator is consistent even when up to 50\% of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables. In a simulation analysis, it is shown to have better finite-sample Type 1 error rates than the inverse-variance weighted method, and is complementary to the recently proposed MR-Egger (Mendelian randomization-Egger) regression method. In analyses of the causal effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary artery disease risk, the inverse-variance weighted method suggests a causal effect of both lipid fractions, whereas the weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods suggest a null effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that corresponds with the experimental evidence. Both median-based and MR-Egger regression methods should be considered as sensitivity analyses for Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants.},

	abstract = {Instrumental variables have been widely used for estimating the causal effect between exposure and outcome. Conventional estimation methods require complete knowledge about all the instruments' validity; a valid instrument must not have a direct effect on the outcome and not be related to unmeasured confounders. Often, this is impractical as highlighted by Mendelian randomization studies where genetic markers are used as instruments and complete knowledge about instruments' validity is equivalent to complete knowledge about the involved genes' functions. In this paper, we propose a method for estimation of causal effects when this complete knowledge is absent. It is shown that causal effects are identified and can be estimated as long as less than \$50\$\% of instruments are invalid, without knowing which of the instruments are invalid. We also introduce conditions for identification when the 50\% threshold is violated. A fast penalized \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ estimation method, called sisVIVE, is introduced for estimating the causal effect without knowing which instruments are valid, with theoretical guarantees on its performance. The proposed method is demonstrated on simulated data and a real Mendelian randomization study concerning the effect of body mass index on health-related quality of life index.

	abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions.
Methods: Here, a new method - the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk.
Results: The MBE presented less bias and lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared with the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia.
Conclusions: The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in sensitivity analyses.},

The ability to identify more homogeneous patient groups could both increase our ability to apply a precision medicine approach to psychiatric disorders and enable elucidation of underlying biological mechanism of pathology. We describe a novel approach to deep phenotyping in mental illness in which contextual term extraction is used to identify constellations of symptoms in a cohort of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and related disorders. We applied topic modeling and dimensionality reduction to identify similar groups of patients and evaluate the resulting clusters through visualization and interrogation of clinically interpretable weighted features. Our findings show that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia may be meaningfully stratified using symptom-based clustering.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Left-right hemispheric asymmetry is an important aspect of healthy brain organization for many functions including language, and can be altered in cognitive and psychiatric disorders1-8. No mechanism has yet been identified for establishing the human brain9s left-right axis9. We performed multivariate genome-wide association scanning (mvGWAS) of cortical regional surface area and thickness asymmetries, and subcortical volume asymmetries, using data from 32,256 participants from the UK Biobank. There were 21 significant loci affecting different aspects of brain asymmetry, with functional enrichment involving microtubule-related genes and embryonic brain expression. These findings are consistent with a known role of the cytoskeleton in left-right axis determination in other organs of invertebrates and frogs10-12. Genetic variants affecting brain asymmetry overlapped with those influencing autism, educational attainment and schizophrenia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {It is well established that higher cognitive ability is associated with larger brain size. However, individual variation in intelligence exists despite brain size and recent studies have shown that a simple unifactorial view of the neurobiology underpinning cognitive ability is probably unrealistic. Educational attainment (EA) is often used as a proxy for cognitive ability since it is easily measured, resulting in large sample sizes and, consequently, sufficient statistical power to detect small associations. This study investigates the association between three global (total surface area (TSA), intra-cranial volume (ICV) and average cortical thickness) and 34 regional cortical measures with educational attainment using a polygenic scoring (PGS) approach. Analyses were conducted on two independent target samples of young twin adults with neuroimaging data, from Australia (N ​= ​1097) and the USA (N ​= ​723), and found that higher EA-PGS were significantly associated with larger global brain size measures, ICV and TSA (R2 ​= ​0.006 and 0.016 respectively, p ​{\textless} ​0.001) but not average thickness. At the regional level, we identified seven cortical regions—in the frontal and temporal lobes—that showed variation in surface area and average cortical thickness over-and-above the global effect. These regions have been robustly implicated in language, memory, visual recognition and cognitive processing. Additionally, we demonstrate that these identified brain regions partly mediate the association between EA-PGS and cognitive test performance. Altogether, these findings advance our understanding of the neurobiology that underpins educational attainment and cognitive ability, providing focus points for future research.},

In order to motivate scholars to examine this convention, we introduce a simple approach based on graphical tools of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a well-established biostatistical methodology. In this context, we propose employing a p-values-based method, taking into account the stochastic nature of p-values. We focus on the modern statistical literature to address the expected p-value (EPV) as a measure of the performance of decision-making rules. During the course of our study, we extend the EPV concept to be considered in terms of the ROC curve technique. This provides expressive evaluations and visualizations of a wide spectrum of testing mechanisms' properties. We show that the conventional power characterization of tests is a partial aspect of the presented EPV/ROC technique. We desire that this explanation of the EPV/ROC approach convinces researchers of the usefulness of the EPV/ROC approach for depicting different characteristics of decision-making procedures, in light of the growing interest regarding correct p-values-based applications.},

The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.},

Whether this association reflects causal association is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the causal association of AF with Alzheimer disease. Methods and Results We used a 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach to evaluate the causal effect of AF on Alzheimer disease. Summary data on the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with AF were obtained from a recently published genome-wide association study with up to 1 030 836 individuals and data on single nucleotide polymorphism-Alzheimer disease association from another genome-wide association study with up to 455 258 individuals. AF was mainly diagnosed according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10) and Alzheimer disease was mainly diagnosed according to clinical criteria (eg, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA] criteria). Effect estimates were calculated using the inverse-variance weighted method. The Mendelian randomization analysis showed nonsignificant association of genetically predicted AF with risk of Alzheimer disease (odds ratio=1.002, 95\% CI: 0.996-1.009, P=0.47) using 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms as the instruments. Mendelian randomization-Egger indicated no evidence of genetic pleiotropy (intercept=0.0002, 95\% CI: -0.001 to 0.001, P=0.70). Conclusions This Mendelian randomization analysis found no evidence to support causal association between AF and Alzheimer disease.},

The use of multivariable prediction models could result in more efficient primary AF screening by selecting at-risk individuals. We aimed to determine which model may be best suitable for increasing efficiency of future primary AF screening efforts.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review on multivariable models derived, validated, and/or augmented for AF prediction in community cohorts using Pubmed, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) through 1 August 2019. We performed meta-analysis of model discrimination with the summary C-statistic as the primary expression of associations using a random effects model. In case of high heterogeneity, we calculated a 95\% prediction interval. We used the CHARMS (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies) checklist for risk of bias assessment. We included 27 studies with a total of 2 978 659 unique participants among 20 cohorts with mean age ranging from 42 to 76 years. We identified 21 risk models used for incident AF risk in community cohorts. Three models showed significant summary discrimination despite high heterogeneity: CHARGE-AF (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) [summary C-statistic 0.71; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.66-0.76], FHS-AF (Framingham Heart Study risk score for AF) (summary C-statistic 0.70; 95\% CI 0.64-0.76), and CHA2DS2-VASc (summary C-statistic 0.69; 95\% CI 0.64-0.74). Of these, CHARGE-AF and FHS-AF had originally been derived for AF incidence prediction. Only CHARGE-AF, which comprises easily obtainable measurements and medical history elements, showed significant summary discrimination among cohorts that had applied a uniform (5-year) risk prediction window.
CONCLUSION: CHARGE-AF appeared most suitable for primary screening purposes in terms of performance and applicability in older community cohorts of predominantly European descent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have found ischemic stroke is associated with atrial fibrillation. However, the causal association between ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation is not clear. Furthermore, the network relationship among ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation and its risk factors need further attention. This study aims to examine the potential causal association between ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation and further to explore potential mediators in the causal pathway from ischemic stroke to atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: Summary statistics from the ISGC (case = 10,307 and control = 19,326) were used as ischemic stroke genetic instruments, AFGen Consortium data (case = 65,446 and control = 522,744) were used for atrial fibrillation, and other consortia data were used for potential mediators (fasting insulin, white blood cell count, procalcitonin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and height). Under the framework of network Mendelian randomization, two-sample Mendelian randomization study was performed using summary statistics from several genome-wide association studies. Inverse-variance weighted method was performed to estimate causal effect.
RESULTS: Blood pressure mediates the causal pathways from ischemic stroke to atrial fibrillation. The total odds ratio of ischemic stroke on atrial fibrillation was 1.05 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.07; P = 1.3 × 10-5). One-unit increase of genetically determined ischemic stroke was associated with 0.02 (DBP: 95\% CI, 0.001 to 0.034, P = 0.029; SBP: 95\% CI, 0.006 to 0.034, P = 0.003) upper systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Higher genetically determined systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were associated with higher atrial fibrillation risk (DBP: RR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.35; P = 0.012. SBP: RR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.38; P = 0.04). Specially, we also found the bidirectional causality between blood pressure and ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided a strong evidence that raised blood pressure in stroke patients increases the risk of atrial fibrillation and active acute blood pressure lowering can improve the outcome in ischemic stroke patients.},

	abstract = {AIM: To assess the risk of stroke and thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation based on risk factor combinations of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using nationwide Danish registries, patients with atrial fibrillation were included from 1997-2015 in this retrospective observational study. A multiple logistic regression, including interactions of history of stroke with age at AF, calendar year of AF, and the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score risk factors (congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, female sex), was used to predict the personalized risks of stroke within 1-year. A total of 147,842 patients with atrial fibrillation were included in the study cohort (median age 76 years, range 20 to 100 years, 51\% females). Within the first year, 6\% of the cohort were diagnosed with stroke. The predicted personalized 1-year absolute risk of stroke varied widely within each CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. To estimate the personalized risk of stroke an online calculator was created, the Calculator of Absolute Stroke Risk (CARS), which allows calculation of all the possible combinations of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. https://hjerteforeningen.shinyapps.io/riskvisrr/.
Calculation of the individual risk using a risk factor based approach as opposed to using average risk for a particular CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score can improve risk estimates. Furthermore, CARS can assist in the communication of the stroke risk for a more evidence-based shared decision making of whether to initiate oral anticoagulation therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported that atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with cognitive decline and dementia. These studies, however, had limited follow-up, were based mostly on white and highly selected populations, and did not account for attrition. We evaluated the association of incident AF with 20-year change in cognitive performance (accounting for attrition) and incident dementia in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) Study.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from 12 515 participants (mean age, 56.9 [SD, 5.7] years in 1990-1992; 56\% women and 24\% black) from 1990 to 1992 through 2011 to 2013. Incident AF was ascertained from study ECGs and hospital discharge codes. Cognitive tests were performed in 1990 to 1992, 1996 to 1998, and 2011 to 2013. Incident dementia was clinician adjudicated. We used generalized estimating equations and Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association of time-dependent AF with change in Z scores of cognitive tests and incident dementia, respectively. During 20 years, 2106 participants developed AF and 1157 participants developed dementia. After accounting for cardiovascular risk factors, including ischemic stroke, the average decline over 20 years in global cognitive Z score was 0.115 (95\% confidence interval, 0.014-0.215) greater in participants with AF than in those without AF. Further adjustment for attrition by multiple imputation by chained equations strengthened the association. In addition, incident AF was associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-1.45), after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, including ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: AF is associated with greater cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia, independent of ischemic stroke. Because cognitive decline is a precursor to dementia, our findings prompt further investigation to identify specific treatments for AF that will delay the trajectory of cognitive decline and, thus, prevent dementia in patients with AF.},

	abstract = {Aims: It is recommended to perform atrial fibrillation ablation with continuous anticoagulation. Continuous apixaban has not been tested.
Methods and results: We compared continuous apixaban (5 mg b.i.d.) to vitamin K antagonists (VKA, international normalized ratio 2-3) in atrial fibrillation patients at risk of stroke a prospective, open, multi-centre study with blinded outcome assessment. Primary outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 2-5). A high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study quantified acute brain lesions. Cognitive function was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and at end of follow-up. Overall, 674 patients (median age 64 years, 33\% female, 42\% non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 49 sites) were randomized; 633 received study drug and underwent ablation; 335 undertook MRI (25 sites, 323 analysable scans). The primary outcome was observed in 22/318 patients randomized to apixaban, and in 23/315 randomized to VKA \{difference -0.38\% [90\% confidence interval (CI) -4.0\%, 3.3\%], non-inferiority P = 0.0002 at the pre-specified absolute margin of 0.075\}, including 2 (0.3\%) deaths, 2 (0.3\%) strokes, and 24 (3.8\%) ISTH major bleeds. Acute small brain lesions were found in a similar number of patients in each arm [apixaban 44/162 (27.2\%); VKA 40/161 (24.8\%); P = 0.64]. Cognitive function increased at the end of follow-up (median 1 MoCA unit; P = 0.005) without differences between study groups.
Conclusions: Continuous apixaban is safe and effective in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation at risk of stroke with respect to bleeding, stroke, and cognitive function. Further research is needed to reduce ablation-related acute brain lesions.},

Epidemiological studies highlight the close and complex links between HFpEF and AF, the shared risk factors, the high AF occurrence in the natural history of HFpEF, and the independent contribution of each condition to poor outcomes. Diagnosis of HFpEF in the setting of AF is challenging because the symptoms overlap. AF is associated with changes in echocardiographic parameters and circulating natriuretic peptides that confound HFpEF diagnosis. Symptomatic improvement with diuretic therapy supports the presence of HFpEF in patients with concomitant AF.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation and heart failure often coexist, causing substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. β blockers are indicated in patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; however, the efficacy of these drugs in patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation is uncertain. We therefore meta-analysed individual-patient data to assess the efficacy of β blockers in patients with heart failure and sinus rhythm compared with atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: We extracted individual-patient data from ten randomised controlled trials of the comparison of β blockers versus placebo in heart failure. The presence of sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation was ascertained from the baseline electrocardiograph. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Analysis was by intention to treat. Outcome data were meta-analysed with an adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. The study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT0083244, and PROSPERO, number CRD42014010012.
FINDINGS: 18,254 patients were assessed, and of these 13,946 (76\%) had sinus rhythm and 3066 (17\%) had atrial fibrillation at baseline. Crude death rates over a mean follow-up of 1·5 years (SD 1·1) were 16\% (2237 of 13,945) in patients with sinus rhythm and 21\% (633 of 3064) in patients with atrial fibrillation. β-blocker therapy led to a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with sinus rhythm (hazard ratio 0·73, 0·67-0·80; p{\textless}0·001), but not in patients with atrial fibrillation (0·97, 0·83-1·14; p=0·73), with a significant p value for interaction of baseline rhythm (p=0·002). The lack of efficacy for the primary outcome was noted in all subgroups of atrial fibrillation, including age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, heart rate, and baseline medical therapy.
INTERPRETATION: Based on our findings, β blockers should not be used preferentially over other rate-control medications and not regarded as standard therapy to improve prognosis in patients with concomitant heart failure and atrial fibrillation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) are expected to increase dramatically; however, we currently lack comprehensive data on temporal trends in unselected clinical populations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1998 to 2010 of patients with incident AF, excluding major valvular disease, linked to hospital admission data and national statistics. Fifty-seven thousand eight hundred eighteen adults were identified with mean age 74.2 (SD, 11.7) years and 48.3\% women. Overall age-adjusted incidence of AF per 1000 person years was 1.11 (95\% CI, 1.09-1.13) in 1998-2001, 1.33 (1.31-1.34) in 2002-2006, and 1.33 (1.31-1.35) in 2007-2010. Ongoing increases in incidence were noted for patients aged ≥75 years, with similar temporal patterns in women and men. Associated comorbidities varied over time, with a constant prevalence of previous stroke, increases in hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and decreases in ischemic heart disease. Among patients aged 55 to 74 years, there was a significant reduction in mortality over time (P{\textless}0.001), but mortality rates in patients aged ≥75 years remained static at 14\% to 15\% per year (P=0.84). Projections of AF prevalence demonstrated a constant yearly rise, increasing from 700 000 patients in 2010 to between 1.3 and 1.8 million patients with AF in the United Kingdom by 2060.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large general practice population, incident AF increased and then plateaued overall, with a continued increase in patients aged ≥75 years. The large projected increase in AF prevalence associated with temporal changes in AF-related comorbidities suggests the need for comprehensive implementation of AF prevention and management strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown that high levels of serum uric acid (UA) were associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the causal effect of urate on the risk of AF is still unknown. To clarify the potential causal association between UA and AF, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genetic instrumental variables (IVs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the Korean GWAS dataset of 633 patients with AF (mean age 50.6 ± 7.8 years, 80.9\% male, Yonsei AF Ablation cohort) who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation and the data from 3533 controls (from the Korea Genome Epidemiology Study), we selected 9 SNPs, with a P value less than .05, associated with an increased UA serum level. Additionally, we calculated the weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) using the selected 9 SNPs, to use it as an instrumental variable. A Mendelian randomization analysis was calculated by a 2-stage estimator method.
RESULTS: The conventional association between the serum UA and AF was significant (P = .001) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The SNP rs1165196 on SLC17A1 (F-statistics = 208.34, 0.18 mg/mL per allele change, P {\textless} .001) and wGRS (F-statistics = 222.26, 0.20 mg/mL per 1SD change, P {\textless} .001) were significantly associated with an increase in the UA level. The MR analysis was causally associated with rs1165196 (estimated odds ratio (OR), 0.21, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.06-0.75, P = .017), but not wGRS (estimated OR, 1.07, 95\% CI, 0.57-2.01, P = .832).
CONCLUSION: The serum UA level was independently associated with the AF risk.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Observational studies suggest that variations in normal range thyroid function are associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, it remains to be determined whether these associations are causal or not.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether genetically determined variation in normal-range thyroid function is causally associated with the risk of stroke and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and investigate via which pathways these relations may be mediated.
DESIGN: Setting and ParticipantsMendelian Randomization (MR) analyses for stroke and CAD using genetic instruments associated with normal-range TSH and FT4 levels or Hashimoto's disease and Graves' disease. The potential mediating role of known stroke and CAD risk factors was examined. Publically available summary statistics data were used.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stroke or CAD risk per genetically predicted increase in TSH or FT4 levels.
RESULTS: A one SD increase in TSH was associated with a 5\% decrease in the risk of stroke (OR=0.95, 95\% CI= 0.91 to 0.99, p=0.008). Multivariable MR analyses indicated that this effect is mainly mediated via atrial fibrillation (AF). MR analyses did not show a causal association between normal-range thyroid function and CAD. Secondary analyses showed a causal relationship between Hashimoto's Disease and a 7\% increased risk of CAD (OR=1.07, 95\% CI= 1.01 to 1.13, p=0.026), which was mainly mediated via body mass index.
CONCLUSION: These results provide important new insights into the causal relationships and mediating pathways between thyroid function, stroke and CAD. We identify variation in normal-range thyroid function and Hashimoto's Disease as risk factors for stroke and CAD, respectively.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-2 receptor subunit alpha, IL-6, IL-16, IL-17 and IL-18 were identified from genome-wide association studies. Summary-level data of the outcomes were obtained from three large consortia. Genetic predisposition to higher IL-1ra levels were significantly associated with CAD. The odds ratio was 1.36 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.63; P = 5.37 × 10-4) per one standard deviation increase in IL-1ra levels. Genetically higher IL-6 levels, predicted by a variant in the IL6R gene and corresponding to reduced IL-6 bio-function, were significantly inversely associated with CAD and AF. The odds ratios per one standard deviation increase in IL-6 levels were 0.64 (95\%CI, 0.54-0.76; P = 2.22 × 10-7) for CAD and 0.70 (95\%CI, 0.62-0.80; P = 1.34 × 10-7) for AF. There was a suggestive positive association of IL-1ra with cardioembolic stroke and suggestive inverse associations of IL-6 with any ischemic stroke, cardioembolic stroke, and small vessel stroke, and of IL-16 with CAD. The other ILs were not associated with any outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: These results strengthen the evidence that IL-6 inhibition may offer a therapeutic approach for prevention of CAD, AF, and ischemic stroke. In contrast, IL-1 inhibition through raised IL-1ra levels may confer increased risk of CAD and cardioembolic stroke. The role of IL-16 for CAD warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is an increasingly important tool for appraising causality in observational epidemiology. The technique exploits the principle that genotypes are not generally susceptible to reverse causation bias and confounding, reflecting their fixed nature and Mendel’s first and second laws of inheritance. The approach is, however, subject to important limitations and assumptions that, if unaddressed or compounded by poor study design, can lead to erroneous conclusions. Nevertheless, the advent of 2-sample approaches (in which exposure and outcome are measured in separate samples) and the increasing availability of open-access data from large consortia of genome-wide association studies and population biobanks mean that the approach is likely to become routine practice in evidence synthesis and causal inference research. In this article we provide an overview of the design, analysis, and interpretation of MR studies, with a special emphasis on assumptions and limitations. We also consider different analytic strategies for strengthening causal inference. Although impossible to prove causality with any single approach, MR is a highly cost-effective strategy for prioritizing intervention targets for disease prevention and for strengthening the evidence base for public health policy.},

This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. Since it is unlikely that all genetic variants will be valid instrumental variables, several robust methods have been proposed. We compare nine robust methods for MR based on summary data that can be implemented using standard statistical software. Methods were compared in three ways: by reviewing their theoretical properties, in an extensive simulation study, and in an empirical example. In the simulation study, the best method, judged by mean squared error was the contamination mixture method. This method had well-controlled Type 1 error rates with up to 50\% invalid instruments across a range of scenarios. Other methods performed well according to different metrics. Outlier-robust methods had the narrowest confidence intervals in the empirical example. With isolated exceptions, all methods performed badly when over 50\% of the variants were invalid instruments. Our recommendation for investigators is to perform a variety of robust methods that operate in different ways and rely on different assumptions for valid inferences to assess the reliability of MR analyses.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed models are a powerful statistical tool for identifying genetic associations and avoiding confounding. However, existing methods are computationally intractable in large cohorts and may not optimize power. All existing methods require time cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and M is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an infinitesimal genetic architecture in which effect sizes are normally distributed, which can limit power. Here we present a far more efficient mixed-model association method, BOLT-LMM, which requires only a small number of O(MN) time iterations and increases power by modeling more realistic, non-infinitesimal genetic architectures via a Bayesian mixture prior on marker effect sizes. We applied BOLT-LMM to 9 quantitative traits in 23,294 samples from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) and observed significant increases in power, consistent with simulations. Theory and simulations show that the boost in power increases with cohort size, making BOLT-LMM appealing for genome-wide association studies in large cohorts.},

Using data from 85,760 individuals with activity-monitor derived measures of sleep timing we find that the chronotype loci associate with sleep timing: the mean sleep timing of the 5\% of individuals carrying the most morningness alleles is 25 min earlier than the 5\% carrying the fewest. The loci are enriched for genes involved in circadian regulation, cAMP, glutamate and insulin signalling pathways, and those expressed in the retina, hindbrain, hypothalamus, and pituitary.

Participants were categorised as having bipolar disorder (n = 2709), major depression (n = 50 975) or no mood disorder (n = 102 931 and n = 105 284). The outcomes were computerised tests of reasoning, reaction time and memory. The potential mediators were cardiometabolic disease and psychotropic medication. Analyses were informed by graphical methods and controlled for confounding using regression, propensity score-based methods and G-computation.ResultsGroup differences of small magnitude were found on a visuospatial memory test. Z-score differences for the bipolar disorder group were in the range −0.23 to −0.17 (95\% CI −0.39 to −0.03) across different estimation methods, and for the major depression group they were approximately −0.07 (95\% CI −0.10 to −0.03). One-quarter of the effect was mediated via psychotropic medication in the bipolar disorder group (−0.05; 95\% CI −0.09 to −0.01). No evidence was found for mediation via cardiometabolic disease.ConclusionsIn a large community-based sample in middle to early old age, bipolar disorder and depression were associated with lower visuospatial memory performance, in part potentially due to psychotropic medication use.

	abstract = {Objectives Age-related cognitive decline is a well-known phenomenon after age 65 but little is known about earlier changes and prior studies are based on relatively small samples. We investigated the impact of age on cognitive decline in the largest population sample to date including young to old adults. Method Between 100,352 and 468,534 participants aged 38–73 years from UK Biobank completed at least one of seven self-administered cognitive functioning tests: prospective memory (PM), pairs matching (Pairs), fluid intelligence (FI), reaction time (RT), symbol digit substitution, trail making A and B. Up to 26,005 participants completed at least one of two follow-up assessments of PM, Pairs, FI and RT. Multivariable regression models examined the association between age ({\textless}45[reference], 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65+) and cognition scores at baseline. Mixed models estimated the impact of age on cognitive decline over follow-up ({\textasciitilde}5.1 years). Results FI was higher between ages 50 and 64 and lower at 65+ compared to {\textless}45 at baseline. Performance on all other baseline tests was lower with older age: with increasing age category, difference in test scores ranged from 2.5 to 7.8\%(P{\textless}0.0001). Compared to {\textless}45 at baseline, RT and Pairs performance declined faster across all older age cohorts (3.0 and 1.2\% change, respectively, with increasing age category, P{\textless}0.0001). Cross-sectional results yielded 8 to 12-fold higher differences in RT and Pairs with age compared to longitudinal results. Conclusions Our findings suggest that declines in cognitive abilities {\textless}65 are small. The cross-sectional differences in cognition scores for middle to older adult years may be due in part to age cohort effects.},

	abstract = {Background
Previous reports have implicated multiple genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), but the contributions of genome-wide variation to AF susceptibility have not been quantified.

Methods and Results
We assessed the contribution of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation to AF risk (SNP-heritability, h2g) using data from 120,286 unrelated individuals of European ancestry (2,987 with AF) in the population-based UK Biobank. We ascertained AF based on self-report, medical record billing codes, procedure codes, and death records. We estimated h2g using a variance components method with variants having a minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥1\%. We evaluated h2g in age, sex, and genomic strata of interest. The h2g for AF was 22.1\% (95\% CI 15.6\%–28.5\%), and was similar for early- versus older-onset AF (≤65 versus {\textgreater}65 years of age) as well as for men and women. The proportion of AF variance explained by genetic variation was mainly accounted for by common (MAF ≥ 5\%) variants (20.4\%, 95\% CI 15.1\%–25.6\%). Only 6.4\% (95\% CI 5.1–7.7\%) of AF variance was attributed to variation within known AF susceptibility, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy gene regions.

Conclusions
Genetic variation contributes substantially to AF risk. The risk for AF conferred by genomic variation is similar to that observed for several other cardiovascular diseases. Established AF loci only explain a moderate proportion of disease risk, suggesting that further genetic discovery, with an emphasis on common variation, is warranted to understand the causal genetic basis of AF.},

elucidate key aspects of circadian rhythms and the circadian clock-mood connection. However, translation of this knowledge into humans remains incomplete. In recent years, very large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted and the genetic underpinnings of BD are beginning
to emerge. However, these genetic studies in BD do not match well with the evidence from animal studies that implicate the circadian clock in mood regulation. Even larger GWAS have been conducted for circadian phenotypes including chronotype, rhythm amplitude, sleep duration, and insomnia.
These studies have identified a diverse set of associated genes, including a minority with previously well-characterized functions in the circadian clock. Taken together, the data from recent GWAS of BD and circadian phenotypes indicate that the genetic organization of the circadian clock,
both in health and in BD is complex. The findings from GWAS elucidate potentially novel circadian mechanism that may be partly distinct from those identified in animal models. Pleiotropy, epistasis and nongenetic factors may play important roles in regulating circadian rhythms, some of which
may underlie circadian rhythm disturbances in BD.},

Various statistical methods have been developed to detect epistasis in case-control GWAS. These methods face major statistical challenges due to the number of tests required, the complexity of the Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) structure, and the lack of consensus regarding the definition of epistasis. Their limited impact in terms of uncovering new biological knowledge might be explained in part by the limited amount of experimental data available to validate their statistical performances in a realistic GWAS context. In this paper, we introduce a simulation pipeline for generating real scale GWAS data, including epistasis and realistic LD structure. We evaluate five exhaustive bivariate interaction methods, fastepi, GBOOST, SHEsisEpi, DSS, and IndOR. Two hundred thirty four different disease scenarios are considered in extensive simulations. We report the performances of each method in terms of false positive rate control, power, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and computation time using a GPU.

To date, thousands of SNPs have been associated with diseases and other complex traits. Statistical analysis typically looks for association between a phenotype and a SNP taken individually via single-locus tests. However, geneticists admit this is an oversimplified approach to tackle the complexity of underlying biological mechanisms. Interaction between SNPs, namely epistasis, must be considered. Unfortunately, epistasis detection gives rise to analytic challenges since analyzing every SNP combination is at present impractical at a genome-wide scale. In this review, we will present the main strategies recently proposed to detect epistatic interactions, along with their operating principle. Some of these methods are exhaustive, such as multifactor dimensionality reduction, likelihood ratio-based tests or receiver operating characteristic curve analysis; some are non-exhaustive, such as machine learning techniques (random forests, Bayesian networks) or combinatorial optimization approaches (ant colony optimization, computational evolution system).},

Many supervised software packages produce a strong performing universal prediction rule independent of the testing data. In practice, one often wants to achieve the best possible prediction performance on a speciﬁc testing data set. For example, suppose the feature information in the testing data are a set of extrapolations away from the mean of the training data. In this case, more aggressive shrinking may be beneﬁcial. One could view this contrast in terms of a sports metaphor. It is often better to prepare for your speciﬁc opponent (semi-supervised) than to prepare for a generic opponent (supervised). We present the R package SemiSupervised. This package eﬃciently implements a family of semi-supervised techniques and can directly incorporate the feature data corresponding to predictions of interest in training.

However, much of the perceived benefit of such discoveries lies in the promise that the identification of genes that influence disease would directly translate into the identification of potential therapeutic targets, but this has yet to be realized at a level reflecting expectation. One reason for this, we suggest, is that GWAS, to date, have generally not focused on phenotypes that directly relate to the progression of disease and thus speak to disease treatment.},

MR-Egger consists of three parts: (1) a test for directional pleiotropy, (2) a test for a causal effect, and (3) an estimate of the causal effect. While conventional analysis methods for Mendelian randomization assume that all genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions, the MR-Egger method is able to assess whether genetic variants have pleiotropic effects on the outcome that differ on average from zero (directional pleiotropy), as well as to provide a consistent estimate of the causal effect, under a weaker assumption—the InSIDE (INstrument Strength Independent of Direct Effect) assumption. In this paper, we provide a critical assessment of the MR-Egger method with regard to its implementation and interpretation. While the MR-Egger method is a worthwhile sensitivity analysis for detecting violations of the instrumental variable assumptions, there are several reasons why causal estimates from the MR-Egger method may be biased and have inflated Type 1 error rates in practice, including violations of the InSIDE assumption and the influence of outlying variants. The issues raised in this paper have potentially serious consequences for causal inferences from the MR-Egger approach. We give examples of scenarios in which the estimates from conventional Mendelian randomization methods and MR-Egger differ, and discuss how to interpret findings in such cases.},

Opportunities to apply MR are growing rapidly with the increasing number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, existing MR methods rely on strong assumptions that are often violated, leading to false positives. Correlated horizontal pleiotropy, which arises when variants affect both traits through a heritable shared factor, remains a particularly challenging problem. We propose a new MR method, Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE), that accounts for correlated and uncorrelated horizontal pleiotropic effects. We demonstrate, in simulations, that CAUSE avoids more false positives induced by correlated horizontal pleiotropy than other methods. Applied to traits studied in recent GWAS studies, we find that CAUSE detects causal relationships that have strong literature support and avoids identifying most unlikely relationships. Our results suggest that shared heritable factors are common and may lead to many false positives using alternative methods.},

Methods HbA1c and random plasma glucose data were collected for 125 people with diabetes without liver disease and for 29 people awaiting liver transplant with diabetes and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, hereditary haemochromatosis, polycystic liver/kidneys, cryptogenic/non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and α-1-antitrypsin-related disease. Results The median (interquartile range) age of the diabetes with cirrhosis group was 55 (49–63) years compared to 60 (50–71) years (P=0.13) in the group without cirrhosis. In the diabetes with cirrhosis group there were 21 men (72\%) compared with 86 men (69\%) in the group with diabetes and no cirrhosis (P=0.82). Of the group with diabetes and cirrhosis, 27 people (93\%) were of white European ethnicity, two (7\%) were South Asian and none was of Afro-Caribbean/other ethnicity compared with 94 (75\%), 16 (13\%), 10 (8\%)/5 (4\%), respectively, in the group with diabetes and no cirrhosis (P=0.20). Median (interquartile range) HbA1c was 41 (32–56) mmol/mol [5.9 (5.1–7.3)\%] vs 61 (52–70) mmol/mol [7.7 (6.9–8.6)\%] (P{\textless}0.001), respectively, in the diabetes with cirrhosis group vs the diabetes without cirrhosis group. The glucose concentrations were 8.4 (7.0–11.2) mmol/l vs 7.3 (5.2–11.5) mmol/l (P=0.17). HbA1c was depressed by 20 mmol/mol (1.8\%; P{\textless}0.001) in 28 participants with cirrhosis but elevated by 28 mmol/mol (2.6\%) in the participant with α-1-antitrypsin disorder. Those with cirrhosis and depressed HbA1c had fewer larger erythrocytes, and higher red cell distribution width and reticulocyte count. This was reflected in the positive association of glucose with mean cell volume (r=0.39) and haemoglobin level (r=0.49) and the negative association for HbA1c (r=–0.28 and r=–0.26, respectively) in the diabetes group with cirrhosis. Conclusion HbA1c is not an appropriate test for blood glucose in people with cirrhosis and diabetes awaiting transplant as it reflects altered erythrocyte presentation.},

	abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure–outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) studies are often described as naturally occurring randomized trials in which genetic factors are randomly assigned by nature. Conceptualizing MR studies as randomized trials has profound implications for their design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation. For example, analytic practices that are discouraged in randomized trials should also be discouraged in MR studies., Here, we deconstruct the oft-made analogy between MR and randomized trials. We describe four key threats to the analogy between MR studies and randomized trials: (1) exchangeability is not guaranteed; (2) time zero (and therefore the time for setting eligibility criteria) is unclear; (3) the treatment assignment is often measured with error; and (4) adherence is poorly defined. By precisely defining the causal effects being estimated, we underscore that MR estimates are often vaguely analogous to per-protocol effects in randomized trials, and that current MR methods for estimating analogues of per-protocol effects could be biased in practice., We conclude that the analogy between randomized trials and MR studies provides further perspective on both the strengths and the limitations of MR studies as currently implemented, as well as future directions for MR methodology development and application. In particular, the analogy highlights potential future directions for some MR studies to produce more interpretable and informative numerical estimates., Mendelian randomization (MR) studies are often described as naturally occurring randomized trials in which genetic factors are randomly assigned by nature., This analogy between MR and randomized trials is used to defend the superiority of MR analyses over other observational study analyses that require adjustment for measured confounders, and to position MR studies as the preferred source of evidence when trial data are not available. For example, recent clinical guideline reports purport MR studies are the best hope for estimating the benefits of screening or treating children for high cholesterol levels, implying MR studies are a welcome substitute for a decades-long trial that would be required to assess the impact on cardiovascular disease incidence.,, When considered in depth, the analogy with randomized trials has profound implications for the design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation of MR studies. Best analytic practices in randomized trials should also be encouraged in MR studies, and methodologic advancements for one study design can potentially be adapted to advance the other design. Likewise, analytic practices that are discouraged in randomized trials should also be discouraged in MR studies., Here, we deconstruct the oft-made analogy between MR studies and randomized trials. We focus on the consequences of the analogy for the design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation of MR studies. In particular, we explore the implications for clinical and public health decision-making of the meaning of effect estimates in MR studies. In so doing, we highlight the benefits of specifying the protocol of the hypothetical randomized trial that the MR study is replacing. Throughout, we use the term “treatment” as synonymous with “exposure.” We begin by defining the average causal effect of treatment assignment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Preference for activity in the morning or evening (chronotype) may impact type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk factors. Our objective was to use Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate whether there are causal links between chronotype and one potential T2D risk factor, total fatty acids (TOTFA), and between TOTFA and T2D.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated the causal effect of: 1) morning chronotype on TOTFA; and 2) higher TOTFA on T2D. We found that: a) morning compared to evening chronotype was associated with lower TOTFA levels (inverse-weighted variance (IVW) estimate -0.21; 95\% CI -0.38, -0.03; raw P = 0.02; FDR-corrected P 0.04) and b) elevated TOTFA levels were protective against T2D (IVW estimate -0.23; 95\% CI -0.41, -0.05; raw P = 0.01; FDR-corrected P = 0.03). Based on this finding, we further hypothesized that healthy fats would show a similar pattern and performed MR of a) morning chronotype on omega-3 (Omega-3), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids; and b) MR of each of these fat types on T2D. We observed the same mediating-type pattern for chronotype, MUFA, and T2D as we had for chronotype, TOTFA, and T2D, and morning chronotype was associated with lower Omega-3.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide suggestive, new information about relationships among chronotype, TOTFA, and T2D and about chronotype as a factor influencing Omega-3, MUFA, and TOTFA levels. In addition, we validated previous knowledge about MUFA and T2D. Morning chronotypes may predispose towards lower levels of TOTFA and some healthy fats, whereas higher levels of TOTFA and MUFA may protect against T2D.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether sleep traits have a causal effect on risk of breast cancer.
DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation study.
SETTING: UK Biobank prospective cohort study and Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) case-control genome-wide association study.
PARTICIPANTS: 156 848 women in the multivariable regression and one sample mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis in UK Biobank (7784 with a breast cancer diagnosis) and 122 977 breast cancer cases and 105 974 controls from BCAC in the two sample MR analysis.
EXPOSURES: Self reported chronotype (morning or evening preference), insomnia symptoms, and sleep duration in multivariable regression, and genetic variants robustly associated with these sleep traits.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Breast cancer diagnosis.
RESULTS: In multivariable regression analysis using UK Biobank data on breast cancer incidence, morning preference was inversely associated with breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.95, 95\% confidence interval 0.93 to 0.98 per category increase), whereas there was little evidence for an association between sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Using 341 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with chronotype, 91 SNPs associated with sleep duration, and 57 SNPs associated with insomnia symptoms, one sample MR analysis in UK Biobank provided some supportive evidence for a protective effect of morning preference on breast cancer risk (0.85, 0.70, 1.03 per category increase) but imprecise estimates for sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Two sample MR using data from BCAC supported findings for a protective effect of morning preference (inverse variance weighted odds ratio 0.88, 95\% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.93 per category increase) and adverse effect of increased sleep duration (1.19, 1.02 to 1.39 per hour increase) on breast cancer risk (both oestrogen receptor positive and oestrogen receptor negative), whereas evidence for insomnia symptoms was inconsistent. Results were largely robust to sensitivity analyses accounting for horizontal pleiotropy.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings showed consistent evidence for a protective effect of morning preference and suggestive evidence for an adverse effect of increased sleep duration on breast cancer risk.},

Variation in chronotype has been linked to sleep disorders, cognitive and physical performance, and chronic disease.

We identify 12 new genetic loci that implicate known components of the circadian clock machinery and point to previously unstudied genetic variants and candidate genes that might modulate core circadian rhythms or light-sensing pathways. Pathway analyses highlight central nervous and ocular systems and fear-response-related processes. Genetic correlation analysis suggests chronotype shares underlying genetic pathways with schizophrenia, educational attainment and possibly BMI. Further, Mendelian randomization suggests that evening chronotype relates to higher educational attainment.

	abstract = {Observationally, higher caffeine consumption is associated with poorer sleep and insomnia. We investigated whether these associations are a result of shared genetic risk factors and/or (possibly bidirectional) causal effects. Summary-level data were available from genome-wide association studies on caffeine intake (n = 91 462), plasma caffeine and caffeine metabolic rate (n = 9876), sleep duration and chronotype (being a "morning" versus an "evening" person) (n = 128 266), and insomnia complaints (n = 113 006). First, genetic correlations were calculated, reflecting the extent to which genetic variants influencing caffeine consumption and those influencing sleep overlap. Next, causal effects were estimated with bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization. This approach utilizes the genetic variants most robustly associated with an exposure variable as an "instrument" to test causal effects. Estimates from individual variants were combined using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, weighted median regression and MR-Egger regression. We found no clear evidence for a genetic correlation between caffeine intake and sleep duration (rg = 0.000, p = .998), chronotype (rg = 0.086, p = .192) or insomnia complaints (rg = -0.034, p = .700). For plasma caffeine and caffeine metabolic rate, genetic correlations could not be calculated because of the small sample size. Mendelian randomization did not support causal effects of caffeine intake on sleep, or vice versa. There was weak evidence that higher plasma caffeine levels causally decrease the odds of being a morning person. Although caffeine may acutely affect sleep when taken shortly before bedtime, our findings suggest that a sustained pattern of high caffeine consumption is more likely to be associated with poorer sleep through shared environmental factors. Future research should identify such environments, which could aid the development of interventions to improve sleep.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep problems are common, serving as both a predictor and symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with these bidirectional relationships well established in the literature. While both sleep phenotypes and PTSD are moderately heritable, there has been a paucity of investigation into potential genetic overlap between sleep and PTSD. Here, we estimate genetic correlations between multiple sleep phenotypes (including insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and chronotype) and PTSD, using results from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date of PTSD, as well as publicly available GWAS results for sleep phenotypes within UK Biobank data (23 variations, encompassing four main phenotypes).
METHODS: Genetic correlations were estimated utilizing linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), an approach that uses GWAS summary statistics to compute genetic correlations across traits, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to follow up on significant correlations.
RESULTS: Significant, moderate genetic correlations were found between insomnia symptoms (rg range 0.36-0.49), oversleeping (rg range 0.32-0.44), undersleeping (rg range 0.48-0.49), and PTSD. In contrast, there were mixed results for continuous sleep duration and daytime sleepiness phenotypes, and chronotype was not correlated with PTSD. MR analyses did not provide evidence for casual effects of sleep phenotypes on PTSD.
CONCLUSION: Sleep phenotypes, particularly insomnia symptoms and extremes of sleep duration, have shared genetic etiology with PTSD, but causal relationships were not identified. This highlights the importance of further investigation into the overlapping influences on these phenotypes as sample sizes increase and new methods to investigate directionality and causality become available.},

	doi = {10.1093/ntr/nty230},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smokers are at increased risk of poor sleep behaviors. However, it is largely unknown whether these associations are due to shared (genetic) risk factors and/or causal effects (which may be bidirectional).
METHODS: We obtained summary-level data of genome-wide association studies of smoking (smoking initiation [n = 74 035], cigarettes per day [n = 38 181], and smoking cessation [n = 41 278]) and sleep behaviors (sleep duration and chronotype, or "morningness" [n = 128 266] and insomnia [n = 113 006]). Using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression, we calculated genetic correlations between smoking and sleep behaviors. To investigate causal effects, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR), both with summary-level data and individual-level data (n = 333 581 UK Biobank participants). For MR with summary-level data, individual genetic variants were combined with inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, weighted median regression, MR-Robust Adjusted Profile Score, and MR Egger methods.
RESULTS: We found negative genetic correlations between smoking initiation and sleep duration (rg = -.14, 95\% CI = -0.26 to -0.01) and smoking cessation and chronotype (rg = -.18, 95\% CI = -0.31 to -0.06), and positive genetic correlations between smoking initiation and insomnia (rg = .27, 95\% CI = 0.06 to 0.49) and cigarettes per day and insomnia (rg = .15, 95\% CI = 0.01 to 0.28). MR provided strong evidence that smoking more cigarettes causally decreases the odds of being a morning person, (RAPS) and weak evidence that insomnia causally increases smoking heaviness and decreases smoking cessation odds.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking and sleep behaviors show moderate genetic correlation. Heavier smoking seems to causally affect circadian rhythm and there is some indication that insomnia increases smoking heaviness and hampers cessation. Our findings point to sleep as a potentially interesting smoking treatment target.
IMPLICATIONS: Using LD score regression, we found evidence that smoking and different sleep behaviors (sleep duration, chronotype (morningness), and insomnia) are moderately genetically correlated-genetic variants associated with less or poorer sleep also increased the odds of smoking (more heavily). MR analyses suggested that heavier smoking causally affects circadian rhythm (decreasing the odds of being a morning person) and there was some indication that insomnia increases smoking heaviness and hampers smoking cessation. Our findings indicate a complex, bidirectional relationship between smoking and sleep behaviors and point to sleep as a potentially interesting smoking treatment target.},

	abstract = {During the past decade, findings of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) improved our knowledge and understanding of disease genetics. To date, thousands of SNPs have been associated to diseases and other complex traits. Statistical analysis typically looks for association between a phenotype and a SNP taken individually via single-locus tests. However, geneticists admit this is an oversimplified approach to tackle the complexity of underlying biological mechanisms. Interaction between SNPs, namely epistasis, must be considered. Unfortunately, epistasis detection gives rise to analytic challenges since analyzing every SNP combination is at present impractical at a genome-wide scale. In this review, we will present the main strategies recently proposed to detect epistatic interactions, along with their operating principle. Some of these methods are exhaustive, such as multifactor dimensionality reduction, likelihood ratio-based tests or receiver operating characteristic curve analysis; some are non-exhaustive, such as machine learning techniques (random forests, Bayesian networks) or combinatorial optimization approaches (ant colony optimization, computational evolution system).},

	abstract = {Later chronotype (i.e. evening preference) and later timing of sleep have been associated with greater morbidity, including higher rates of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no one has examined whether chronotype is associated with mortality risk to date. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that being an evening type is associated with increased mortality in a large cohort study, the UK Biobank. Our analysis included 433 268 adults aged 38–73 at the time of enrolment and an average 6.5-year follow-up. The primary exposure was chronotype, as assessed through a single selfreported question-defining participants as definite morning types, moderate morning types, moderate evening types or definite evening types. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD. Prevalent disease was also compared among the chronotype groups. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, sleep duration, socioeconomic status and comorbidities. Greater eveningness, particularly being a definite evening type, was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of all comorbidities. Comparing definite evening type to definite morning type, the associations were strongest for psychological disorders (OR 1.94, 95\% CI 1.86–2.02, p = {\textless} 0.001), followed by diabetes (OR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.24–1.36, p = {\textless} 0.001), neurological disorders (OR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.20–1.30, p = {\textless} 0.001), gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.19–1.27, p = {\textless} 0.001) and respiratory disorders (OR 1.22, 95\% CI 1.18–1.26, p = {\textless} 0.001). The total number of deaths was 10 534, out of which 2127 were due to CVD. Greater eveningness, based on chronotype as an ordinal variable, was associated with a small increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.02, 95\% CI 1.004–1.05, p = 0.017) and CVD mortality (HR 1.04, 95\% CI 1.00–1.09, p = 0.06). Compared to definite morning types, definite evening types had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.10, 95\% CI 1.02–1.18, p = 0.012). This first report of increased mortality in evening types is consistent with previous reports of increased levels of cardiometabolic risk factors in this group. Mortality risk in evening types may be due to behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors, many of which may be attributable to chronic misalignment between internal physiological timing and externally imposed timing of work and social activities. These findings suggest the need for researching possible interventions aimed at either modifying circadian rhythms in individuals or at allowing evening types greater working hour flexibility.},

	abstract = {Semi-supervised learning is the branch of machine learning concerned with using labelled as well as unlabelled data to perform certain learning tasks. Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classification, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classification algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.},

	abstract = {Identification of AD (Alzheimer’s disease)-related genes obtained from blood samples is crucial for early AD diagnosis. We used three public datasets, ADNI, AddNeuroMed1 (ANM1), and ANM2, for this study. Five feature selection methods and five classifiers were used to curate AD-related genes and discriminate AD patients, respectively. In the internal validation (five-fold cross-validation within each dataset), the best average values of the area under the curve (AUC) were 0.657, 0.874, and 0.804 for ADNI, ANMI, and ANM2, respectively. In the external validation (training and test sets from different datasets), the best AUCs were 0.697 (training: ADNI to testing: ANM1), 0.764 (ADNI to ANM2), 0.619 (ANM1 to ADNI), 0.79 (ANM1 to ANM2), 0.655 (ANM2 to ADNI), and 0.859 (ANM2 to ANM1), respectively. These results suggest that although the classification performance of ADNI is relatively lower than that of ANM1 and ANM2, classifiers trained using blood gene expression can be used to classify AD for other data sets. In addition, pathway analysis showed that AD-related genes were enriched with inflammation, mitochondria, and Wnt signaling pathways. Our study suggests that blood gene expression data are useful in predicting the AD classification.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is commonly used to assess cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients.
METHODS: We divided 741 participants with blood microarray data in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) into three groups based on their most recent CDR assessment: cognitive normal (CDR=0), mild dementia (CDR=0.5), and probable AD (CDR≥1.0). We then used machine learning to predict cognitive status using only blood RNA levels.
RESULTS: One chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) probe was significant. By combining nonsignificant probes with p-values less than 0.1, we averaged 87.87 (s = 1.02)\% predictive accuracy in classifying the three groups, compared to a 55.46\% baseline for this study.
DISCUSSION: We identified one significant probe in CLIC1. However, CLIC1 levels alone were not sufficient to determine dementia status. We propose that combining individually suggestive, but nonsignificant, blood RNA levels can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy.},

	abstract = {Background
Ontologies are commonly used to annotate and help process life sciences data. Although their original goal is to facilitate integration and interoperability among heterogeneous data sources, when these sources are annotated with distinct ontologies, bridging this gap can be challenging. In the last decade, ontology matching systems have been evolving and are now capable of producing high-quality mappings for life sciences ontologies, usually limited to the equivalence between two ontologies. However, life sciences research is becoming increasingly transdisciplinary and integrative, fostering the need to develop matching strategies that are able to handle multiple ontologies and more complex relations between their concepts.

Results
We have developed ontology matching algorithms that are able to find compound mappings between multiple biomedical ontologies, in the form of ternary mappings, finding for instance that “aortic valve stenosis”(HP:0001650) is equivalent to the intersection between “aortic valve”(FMA:7236) and “constricted” (PATO:0001847). The algorithms take advantage of search space filtering based on partial mappings between ontology pairs, to be able to handle the increased computational demands. The evaluation of the algorithms has shown that they are able to produce meaningful results, with precision in the range of 60-92\% for new mappings. The algorithms were also applied to the potential extension of logical definitions of the OBO and the matching of several plant-related ontologies.

Conclusions
This work is a first step towards finding more complex relations between multiple ontologies. The evaluation shows that the results produced are significant and that the algorithms could satisfy specific integration needs.},

We observed high inter-individual variability in the rates of change of cellular frequencies that was dictated by their baseline values, allowing identification of steady-state levels toward which a cell subset converged and the ordered convergence of multiple cell subsets toward an older adult homeostasis. These data form a highdimensional trajectory of immune aging (IMM-AGE) that describes a person’s immune status better than chronological age.

	abstract = {Gene function prediction is a complex computational problem, characterized by several items: the number of functional classes is large, and a gene may belong to multiple classes; functional classes are structured according to a hierarchy; classes are usually unbalanced, with more negative than positive examples; class labels can be uncertain and the annotations largely incomplete; to improve the predictions, multiple sources of data need to be properly integrated. In this contribution, we focus on the first three items, and, in particular, on the development of a new method for the hierarchical genome-wide and ontology-wide gene function prediction. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the “true path rule” (TPR) that governs both the Gene Ontology and FunCat taxonomies. According to this rule, the proposed TPR ensemble method is characterized by a two-way asymmetric flow of information that traverses the graph-structured ensemble: positive predictions for a node influence in a recursive way its ancestors, while negative predictions influence its offsprings. Cross-validated results with the model organism S. Crevisiae, using seven different sources of biomolecular data, and a theoretical analysis of the the TPR algorithm show the effectiveness and the drawbacks of the proposed approach.},

Though the ABA offers their own search engine and software for researchers to view their growing collection of online public data sets, including extensive gene expression and neuroanatomical data from human and mouse brain, many of their tools limit the amount of genes and brain structures researchers can view at once. To complement their work, ABADV generates multiple pie charts, bar charts and heat maps of expression energy values for any given set of genes and brain structures. Such a suite of free and easy-to-understand visualizations allows for easy comparison of gene expression across multiple brain areas. In addition, each visualization links back to the ABA so researchers may view a summary of the experimental detail. ABADV is currently supported on modern web browsers and is compatible with expression energy data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas in situ hybridization data. By creating this web application, researchers can immediately obtain and survey numerous amounts of expression energy data from the ABA, which they can then use to supplement their work or perform meta-analysis. In the future, we hope to enable ABADV across multiple data resources.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of oversampling the minority (abnormal)cla ss and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)tha n only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)t han varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC)and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are approximately 24 h cycles in physiology and behaviour that enable organisms to anticipate predictable rhythmic changes in their environment. These rhythms are a hallmark of normal healthy physiology, and disruption of circadian rhythms has implications for cognitive, metabolic, cardiovascular and immune function. Circadian disruption is of increasing concern, and may occur as a result of the pressures of our modern 24/7 society—including artificial light exposure, shift-work and jet-lag. In addition, circadian disruption is a common comorbidity in many different conditions, ranging from aging to neurological disorders. A key feature of circadian disruption is the breakdown of robust, reproducible rhythms with increasing fragmentation between activity and rest. Circadian researchers have developed a range of methods for estimating the period of time series, typically based upon periodogram analysis. However, the methods used to quantify circadian disruption across the literature are not consistent. Here we describe a range of different measures that have been used to measure circadian disruption, with a particular focus on laboratory rodent data. These methods include periodogram power, variability in activity onset, light phase activity, activity bouts, interdaily stability, intradaily variability and relative amplitude. The strengths and limitations of these methods are described, as well as their normal ranges and interrelationships. Whilst there is an increasing appreciation of circadian disruption as both a risk to health and a potential therapeutic target, greater consistency in the quantification of disrupted rhythms is needed.},

	abstract = {Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8\% for AD classification and 83.7\% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0\% for AD classification and 84.2\% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as—omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Identifying MCI subjects who are at high risk of converting to AD is crucial for effective treatments. In this study, a deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is designed to accurately predict MCI-to-AD conversion with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. First, MRI images are prepared with age-correction and other processing. Second, local patches, which are assembled into 2.5 dimensions, are extracted from these images. Then, the patches from AD and normal controls (NC) are used to train a CNN to identify deep learning features of MCI subjects. After that, structural brain image features are mined with FreeSurfer to assist CNN. Finally, both types of features are fed into an extreme learning machine classifier to predict the AD conversion. The proposed approach is validated on the standardized MRI datasets from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. This approach achieves an accuracy of 79.9\% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 86.1\% in leave-one-out cross validations. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed one outperforms others with higher accuracy and AUC, while keeping a good balance between the sensitivity and specificity. Results demonstrate great potentials of the proposed CNN-based approach for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with solely MRI data. Age correction and assisted structural brain image features can boost the prediction performance of CNN.},

	abstract = {What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.},

	abstract = {Finding the biomarkers associated with ASD is helpful for understanding the underlying roots of the disorder and can lead to earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatment. A promising approach to identify biomarkers is using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can be used to analyze graph structured data, i.e. brain networks constructed by fMRI. One way to interpret important features is through looking at how the classification probability changes if the features are occluded or replaced. The major limitation of this approach is that replacing values may change the distribution of the data and lead to serious errors. Therefore, we develop a 2-stage pipeline to eliminate the need to replace features for reliable biomarker interpretation. Specifically, we propose an inductive GNN to embed the graphs containing different properties of task-fMRI for identifying ASD and then discover the brain regions/sub-graphs used as evidence for the GNN classifier. We first show GNN can achieve high accuracy in identifying ASD. Next, we calculate the feature importance scores using GNN and compare the interpretation ability with Random Forest. Finally, we run with different atlases and parameters, proving the robustness of the proposed method. The detected biomarkers reveal their association with social behaviors. We also show the potential of discovering new informative biomarkers. Our pipeline can be generalized to other graph feature importance interpretation problems.},

	abstract = {The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has discovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with diseases and quantitative traits. However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time. Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype. While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA, can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21\% more independent SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach, while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides 37\% increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel heritable phenotypes.},

brain disorder. Earlier detection of Alzheimer’s disease can help with proper treatment and prevent brain tissue damage. Several statistical and machine learning models have been exploited by researchers for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. Analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common practice for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis in clinical research. Detection of Alzheimer’s disease is exacting due to the similarity in Alzheimer’s disease MRI data and standard healthy MRI data of older people. Recently, advanced deep learning techniques have successfully demonstrated human-level performance in numerous fields including medical image analysis. We propose a deep convolutional neural network for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis using brain 
MRI data analysis. While most of the existing approaches perform binary classification, our model can identify different stages of Alzheimer’s disease and obtains superior performance for early-stage diagnosis. We conducted ample experiments to demonstrate that our proposed model outperformed comparative baselines on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies dataset.},

	abstract = {Recently, Wu and colleagues [1] proposed two novel statistics for genome-wide interaction analysis using case/control or case-only data. In computer simulations, their proposed case/control statistic outperformed competing approaches, including the fast-epistasis option in PLINK and logistic regression analysis under the correct model; however, reasons for its superior performance were not fully explored. Here we investigate the theoretical properties and performance of Wu et al.'s proposed statistics and explain why, in some circumstances, they outperform competing approaches. Unfortunately, we find minor errors in the formulae for their statistics, resulting in tests that have higher than nominal type 1 error. We also find minor errors in PLINK's fast-epistasis and case-only statistics, although theory and simulations suggest that these errors have only negligible effect on type 1 error. We propose adjusted versions of all four statistics that, both theoretically and in computer simulations, maintain correct type 1 error rates under the null hypothesis. We also investigate statistics based on correlation coefficients that maintain similar control of type 1 error. Although designed to test specifically for interaction, we show that some of these previously-proposed statistics can, in fact, be sensitive to main effects at one or both loci, particularly in the presence of linkage disequilibrium. We propose two new “joint effects” statistics that, provided the disease is rare, are sensitive only to genuine interaction effects. In computer simulations we find, in most situations considered, that highest power is achieved by analysis under the correct genetic model. Such an analysis is unachievable in practice, as we do not know this model. However, generally high power over a wide range of scenarios is exhibited by our joint effects and adjusted Wu statistics. We recommend use of these alternative or adjusted statistics and urge caution when using Wu et al.'s originally-proposed statistics, on account of the inflated error rate that can result.},

	abstract = {Although great progress in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been made, the significant SNP associations identified by GWAS account for only a few percent of the genetic variance, leading many to question where and how we can find the missing heritability. There is increasing interest in genome-wide interaction analysis as a possible source of finding heritability unexplained by current GWAS. However, the existing statistics for testing interaction have low power for genome-wide interaction analysis. To meet challenges raised by genome-wide interactional analysis, we have developed a novel statistic for testing interaction between two loci (either linked or unlinked). The null distribution and the type I error rates of the new statistic for testing interaction are validated using simulations. Extensive power studies show that the developed statistic has much higher power to detect interaction than classical logistic regression. The results identified 44 and 211 pairs of SNPs showing significant evidence of interactions with FDR{\textless}0.001 and 0.001{\textless}FDR{\textless}0.003, respectively, which were seen in two independent studies of psoriasis. These included five interacting pairs of SNPs in genes LST1/NCR3, CXCR5/BCL9L, and GLS2, some of which were located in the target sites of miR-324-3p, miR-433, and miR-382, as well as 15 pairs of interacting SNPs that had nonsynonymous substitutions. Our results demonstrated that genome-wide interaction analysis is a valuable tool for finding remaining missing heritability unexplained by the current GWAS, and the developed novel statistic is able to search significant interaction between SNPs across the genome. Real data analysis showed that the results of genome-wide interaction analysis can be replicated in two independent studies.},

	abstract = {Background
Medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy is one of the key biomarkers to detect early neurodegenerative changes in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is active research aimed at identifying automated methodologies able to extract accurate classification indexes from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Such indexes should be fit for identifying AD patients as early as possible.
Subjects
A reference group composed of 144AD patients and 189 age-matched controls was used to train and test the procedure. It was then applied on a study group composed of 302 MCI subjects, 136 having progressed to clinically probable AD (MCI-converters) and 166 having remained stable or recovered to normal condition after a 24month follow-up (MCI-non converters). All subjects came from the ADNI database.
Methods
We sampled the brain with 7 relatively small volumes, mainly centered on the MTL, and 2 control regions. These volumes were filtered to give intensity and textural MRI-based features. Each filtered region was analyzed with a Random Forest (RF) classifier to extract relevant features, which were subsequently processed with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Once a prediction model was trained and tested on the reference group, it was used to compute a classification index (CI) on the MCI cohort and to assess its accuracy in predicting AD conversion in MCI patients. The performance of the classification based on the features extracted by the whole 9 volumes is compared with that derived from each single volume. All experiments were performed using a bootstrap sampling estimation, and classifier performance was cross-validated with a 20-fold paradigm.
Results
We identified a restricted set of image features correlated with the conversion to AD. It is shown that most information originate from a small subset of the total available features, and that it is enough to give a reliable assessment. We found multiple, highly localized image-based features which alone are responsible for the overall clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The classification index is able to discriminate Controls from AD with an Area Under Curve (AUC)=0.97 (sensitivity ≃89\% at specificity ≃94\%) and Controls from MCI-converters with an AUC=0.92 (sensitivity ≃89\% at specificity ≃80\%). MCI-converters are separated from MCI-non converters with AUC=0.74(sensitivity ≃72\% at specificity ≃65\%).
Findings
The present automated MRI-based technique revealed a strong relationship between highly localized baseline-MRI features and the baseline clinical assessment. In addition, the classification index was also used to predict the probability of AD conversion within a time frame of two years. The definition of a single index combining local analysis of several regions can be useful to detect AD neurodegeneration in a typical MCI population.},

This study was undertaken to identify causal risk factors of knee, hip, and hand OA. Methods Individual-level data from 384,838 unrelated participants in the UK Biobank study were analyzed. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to test for causality for body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure (BP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The primary outcome measure was OA determined using hospital diagnoses (all sites, n = 48,431; knee, n = 19,727; hip, n = 11,875; hand, n = 2,330). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were calculated. Results MR analyses demonstrated a robust causal association of genetically determined BMI with all OA (OR per SD increase 1.57 [95\% CI 1.44–1.71]), and with knee OA and hip OA, but not with hand OA. Increased genetically determined femoral neck BMD was causally associated with all OA (OR per SD increase 1.14 [95\% CI 1.06–1.22]), knee OA, and hip OA. Low systolic BP was causally associated with all OA (OR per SD decrease 1.55 [95\% CI 1.29–1.87]), knee OA, and hip OA. There was no evidence of causality for the other tested metabolic factors or CRP level. Conclusion Our findings indicate that BMI exerts a major causal effect on the risk of OA at weight-bearing joints, but not at the hand. Evidence of causality of all OA, knee OA, and hip OA was also observed for high femoral neck BMD and low systolic BP.

	abstract = {Alzheimer s disease (AD) pathophysiology is still imperfectly understood and current paradigms have not led to curative outcome. Omics technologies offer great promises for improving our understanding and generating new hypotheses. However, integration and interpretation of such data pose major challenges, calling for adequate knowledge models. AlzPathway is a disease map that gives a detailed and broad account of AD pathophysiology. However, AlzPathway lacks formalism, which can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation. Ontologies are an adequate framework to overcome this limitation, through their axiomatic definitions and logical reasoning properties. We introduce the AD Map Ontology (ADMO) an ontological upper model based on systems biology terms. We then propose to convert AlzPathway into an ontology and to integrate it into ADMO. We demonstrate that it allows one to deal with issues related to redundancy, naming, consistency, process classification and pathway relationships. Further, it opens opportunities to expand the model using elements from other resources, such as generic pathways from Reactome or clinical features contained in the ADO (AD Ontology). A version of the ontology will be made freely available to the community on Bioportal at the time of the confer-ence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomedical ontologies offer the capability to structure and represent domain-specific knowledge semantically. Disease-specific ontologies can facilitate knowledge exchange across multiple disciplines, and ontology-driven mining approaches can generate great value for modeling disease mechanisms. However, in the case of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, there is a lack of formal representation of the relevant knowledge domain.
METHODS: Alzheimer's disease ontology (ADO) is constructed in accordance to the ontology building life cycle. The Protégé OWL editor was used as a tool for building ADO in Ontology Web Language format.
RESULTS: ADO was developed with the purpose of containing information relevant to four main biological views-preclinical, clinical, etiological, and molecular/cellular mechanisms-and was enriched by adding synonyms and references. Validation of the lexicalized ontology by means of named entity recognition-based methods showed a satisfactory performance (F score = 72\%). In addition to structural and functional evaluation, a clinical expert in the field performed a manual evaluation and curation of ADO. Through integration of ADO into an information retrieval environment, we show that the ontology supports semantic search in scientific text. The usefulness of ADO is authenticated by dedicated use case scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: Development of ADO as an open ADO is a first attempt to organize information related to Alzheimer's disease in a formalized, structured manner. We demonstrate that ADO is able to capture both established and scattered knowledge existing in scientific text.},

In this article, we propose a general framework for adjusting association statistics to account for overlapping subjects within a meta-analysis. The key idea of our method is to transform the covariance structure of the data, so it can be used in downstream analyses. As a result, the strategy is very flexible and allows a wide range of meta-analysis methods, such as the random effects model, to account for overlapping subjects. Using simulations and real datasets, we demonstrate that our method has utility in meta-analyses of GWAS, as well as in a multi-tissue mouse expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) study where our method increases the number of discovered eQTL by up to 19\% compared with existing methods.},

	abstract = {Background
Gene Ontology (GO) is a standard vocabulary of functional terms and allows for coherent annotation of gene products. These annotations provide a basis for new methods that compare gene products regarding their molecular function and biological role.

Results
We present a new method for comparing sets of GO terms and for assessing the functional similarity of gene products. The method relies on two semantic similarity measures; simRel and funSim. One measure (simRel) is applied in the comparison of the biological processes found in different groups of organisms. The other measure (funSim) is used to find functionally related gene products within the same or between different genomes. Results indicate that the method, in addition to being in good agreement with established sequence similarity approaches, also provides a means for the identification of functionally related proteins independent of evolutionary relationships. The method is also applied to estimating functional similarity between all proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to visualizing the molecular function space of yeast in a map of the functional space. A similar approach is used to visualize the functional relationships between protein families.

Conclusion
The approach enables the comparison of the underlying molecular biology of different taxonomic groups and provides a new comparative genomics tool identifying functionally related gene products independent of homology. The proposed map of the functional space provides a new global view on the functional relationships between gene products or protein families.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13073-014-0122-2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role during mammalian development. Around birth in humans, the main site of red blood cell production moves from the fetal liver to the bone marrow. DNA methylation changes at the β-globin locus and a switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin production characterize this transition. Understanding this globin switch may improve the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, two of the most common Mendelian diseases in the world. The goal of our study was to describe and compare the genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in fetal and adult human erythroblasts.
METHODS: We used the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 k BeadChip to measure DNA methylation at 402,819 CpGs in ex vivo-differentiated erythroblasts from 12 fetal liver and 12 bone marrow CD34+ donors.
RESULTS: We identified 5,937 differentially methylated CpGs that overlap with erythroid enhancers and binding sites for erythropoiesis-related transcription factors. Combining this information with genome-wide association study results, we show that erythroid enhancers define particularly promising genomic regions to identify new genetic variants associated with fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in humans. Many differentially methylated CpGs are located near genes with unanticipated roles in red blood cell differentiation and proliferation. For some of these new candidate genes, we confirm the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression levels in red blood cell progenitors. We also provide evidence that DNA methylation and genetic variation at the β-globin locus independently control globin gene expression in adult erythroblasts.
CONCLUSIONS: Our DNA methylome maps confirm the widespread dynamic changes in DNA methylation that occur during human erythropoiesis. These changes tend to happen near erythroid enhancers, further highlighting their importance in erythroid regulation and HbF production. Finally, DNA methylation may act independently of the transcription factor BCL11A to repress fetal hemoglobin production. This provides cues on strategies to more efficiently re-activate HbF production in sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia patients.},

Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification.

	abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure–outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

As publicly-available summarized data on genetic associations with disease outcomes from large consortia are becoming more abundant, use of published data is an attractive analysis strategy for obtaining precise estimates of the causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. We detail the necessary steps for conducting Mendelian randomization investigations using published data, and present novel statistical methods for combining data on the associations of multiple (correlated or uncorrelated) genetic variants with the risk factor and outcome into a single causal effect estimate. A two-sample analysis strategy may be employed, in which evidence on the gene-risk factor and gene-outcome associations are taken from different data sources. These approaches allow the efficient identification of risk factors that are suitable targets for clinical intervention from published data, although the ability to assess the assumptions necessary for causal inference is diminished. Methods and guidance are illustrated using the example of the causal effect of serum calcium levels on fasting glucose concentrations. The estimated causal effect of a 1 standard deviation (0.13 mmol/L) increase in calcium levels on fasting glucose (mM) using a single lead variant from the CASR gene region is 0.044 (95 \% credible interval −0.002, 0.100). In contrast, using our method to account for the correlation between variants, the corresponding estimate using 17 genetic variants is 0.022 (95 \% credible interval 0.009, 0.035), a more clearly positive causal effect.},

The objective of this study was to compare performance of logistic regression (LR) with machine learning (ML) for clinical prediction modeling in the literature.
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a Medline literature search (1/2016 to 8/2017) and extracted comparisons between LR and ML models for binary outcomes.
Results
We included 71 of 927 studies. The median sample size was 1,250 (range 72–3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5–563) and eight events per predictor (range 0.3–6,697). The most common ML methods were classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. In 48 (68\%) studies, we observed potential bias in the validation procedures. Sixty-four (90\%) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79\%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an LR and ML model (AUC range, 0.52–0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95\% confidence interval, −0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit(AUC) was 0.34 (0.20–0.47) higher for ML.
Conclusion
We found no evidence of superior performance of ML over LR. Improvements in methodology and reporting are needed for studies that compare modeling algorithms.},

The conventional way of measuring the IC of word senses is to combine knowledge of their hierarchical structure from an ontology like WordNet with statistics on their actual usage in text as derived from a large corpus. In this paper we present a wholly intrinsic measure of IC that relies on hierarchical structure alone. We report that this measure is consequently easier to calculate, yet when used as the basis of a similarity mechanism it yields judgments that correlate more closely with human assessments than other, extrinsic measures of IC that additionally employ corpus analysis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the design and ongoing conduct of the Million Veteran Program (MVP), as an observational cohort study and mega-biobank in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data are being collected from participants using questionnaires, the VA electronic health record, and a blood sample for genomic and other testing. Several ongoing projects are linked to MVP, both as peer-reviewed research studies and as activities to help develop an infrastructure for future, broad-based research uses.
RESULTS: Formal planning for MVP commenced in 2009; the protocol was approved in 2010, and enrollment began in 2011. As of August 3, 2015, and with a steady state of ≈50 recruiting sites nationwide, N = 397,104 veterans have been enrolled. Among N = 199,348 with currently available genotyping data, most participants (as expected) are male (92.0\%) between the ages of 50 and 69 years (55.0\%). On the basis of self-reported race, white (77.2\%) and African American (13.5\%) populations are well represented.
CONCLUSIONS: By helping to promote the future integration of genetic testing in health care delivery, including clinical decision making, the MVP is designed to contribute to the development of precision medicine.},

Semantic similarity measures exploit knowledge sources as the base to perform the estimations. In recent years, ontologies have grown in interest thanks to global initiatives such as the Semantic Web, offering an structured knowledge representation. Thanks to the possibilities that ontologies enable regarding semantic interpretation of terms many ontology-based similarity measures have been developed. According to the principle in which those measures base the similarity assessment and the way in which ontologies are exploited or complemented with other sources several families of measures can be identified. In this paper, we survey and classify most of the ontology-based approaches developed in order to evaluate their advantages and limitations and compare their expected performance both from theoretical and practical points of view. We also present a new ontology-based measure relying on the exploitation of taxonomical features. The evaluation and comparison of our approach’s results against those reported by related works under a common framework suggest that our measure provides a high accuracy without some of the limitations observed in other works.},

	abstract = {Detection of publication and related biases remains suboptimal and threatens the validity and interpretation of meta-analytical findings. When bias is present, it usually differentially affects small and large studies manifesting as an association between precision and effect size and therefore visual asymmetry of conventional funnel plots. This asymmetry can be quantified and Egger's regression is, by far, the most widely used statistical measure for quantifying funnel plot asymmetry. However, concerns have been raised about both the visual appearance of funnel plots and the sensitivity of Egger's regression to detect such asymmetry, particularly when the number of studies is small. In this article, we propose a new graphical method, the Doi plot, to visualize asymmetry and also a new measure, the LFK index, to detect and quantify asymmetry of study effects in Doi plots. We demonstrate that the visual representation of asymmetry was better for the Doi plot when compared with the funnel plot. We also show that the diagnostic accuracy of the LFK index in discriminating between asymmetry due to simulated publication bias versus chance or no asymmetry was also better with the LFK index which had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74-0.88 with simulations of meta-analyses with five, 10, 15, and 20 studies. The Egger's regression result had lower areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.58-0.75 across the same simulations. The LFK index also had a higher sensitivity (71.3-72.1\%) than the Egger's regression result (18.5-43.0\%). We conclude that the methods proposed in this article can markedly improve the ability of researchers to detect bias in meta-analysis.},

METHODS We discussed the main features of the following methods to assess publication bias: funnel plot analysis; trim-and-fill methods; regression techniques and selection models. We applied these methods to a well-known example of antidepressants trials that compared trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for regulatory approval. RESULTS The funnel plot-related methods (visual inspection, trim-and-fill, regression models) revealed an association between effect size and SE. Contours of statistical significance showed that asymmetry in the funnel plot is probably due to publication bias. Selection model found a significant correlation between effect size and propensity for publication. CONCLUSIONS Researchers should always consider the possible impact of publication bias. Funnel plot-related methods should be seen as a means of examining for small-study effects and not be directly equated with publication bias. Possible causes for funnel plot asymmetry should be explored. Contours of statistical significance may help disentangle whether asymmetry in a funnel plot is caused by publication bias or not. Selection models, although underused, could be useful resource when publication bias and heterogeneity are suspected because they address directly the problem of publication bias and not that of small-study effects.},

METHODS: Visual assessment of bias in a funnel plot is quantified using two new statistics: the Imbalance and the Asymmetry Distance, both intended to replicate how a funnel plot is typically assessed. A simulation study was performed to assess the performance of these two statistics for identifying publication bias.
RESULTS: The two statistics both have high type I error and low statistical power, unless the number of studies in the meta-analysis is very large. These results suggest that visual inspection of a funnel plot is unlikely to lead to a valid assessment of publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: In most systematic reviews, visual inspection of a funnel plot may give a misleading impression of the presence or absence of publication bias. Formal statistical tests for bias should generally be preferred.},

	abstract = {Small-study effects are a common threat in systematic reviews and may indicate publication bias. Their existence is often verified by visual inspection of the funnel plot. Formal tests to assess the presence of funnel plot asymmetry typically estimate the association between the reported effect size and their standard error, the total sample size, or the inverse of the total sample size. In this paper, we demonstrate that the application of these tests may be less appropriate in meta-analysis of survival data, where censoring influences statistical significance of the hazard ratio. We subsequently propose 2 new tests that are based on the total number of observed events and adopt a multiplicative variance component. We compare the performance of the various funnel plot asymmetry tests in an extensive simulation study where we varied the true hazard ratio (0.5 to 1), the number of published trials (N=10 to 100), the degree of censoring within trials (0\% to 90\%), and the mechanism leading to participant dropout (noninformative versus informative). Results demonstrate that previous well-known tests for detecting funnel plot asymmetry suffer from low power or excessive type-I error rates in meta-analysis of survival data, particularly when trials are affected by participant dropout. Because our novel test (adopting estimates of the asymptotic precision as study weights) yields reasonable power and maintains appropriate type-I error rates, we recommend its use to evaluate funnel plot asymmetry in meta-analysis of survival data. The use of funnel plot asymmetry tests should, however, be avoided when there are few trials available for any meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses.
DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision.
RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

	abstract = {Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy)., Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger’s test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables., Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples., Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

	abstract = {Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia, although the pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Population-based genetic studies have identified a susceptibility locus for AF at the gene ZFHX3.
Hypothesis We hypothesized that a cardiac-restricted knockout of the transcription factor ZFHX3 in a mammalian model organism would perturb normal cardiac development and function, and illuminate the role of ZFHX3 in AF.
Methods and results We generated a murine cardiac-restricted knockdown of ZFHX3 using cre-lox recombination. Knockdown was confirmed by organ specific genotyping. Among knockdown mice, increased inducibility of atrial arrhythmias was observed at in vivo electrophysiology testing at 3 months of age (\% arrhythmia induction maneuvers 10 vs 0, p{\textless}0.001). Cardiac structure and function was normal in the knockdown mice at 3 months. Premature mortality was noted among the knockdown mice, with death occurring at 9–10 months of age (cox proportional HR sp{\textless}0.01) (figure 1). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe cardiomyopathy prior to death, with impaired left ventricular function and atrial enlargement. Histology of the affected hearts revealed severely dilated and fibrosed atria containing a large mass consistent with thrombus. Immunofluorescence of mouse hearts from early embryonic to adult stages confirmed cardiac expression of ZFHX3, with a marked atrial predominance. Optical mapping of Langendorff-perfused hearts demonstrated increased conduction velocity in knockdown atria (p{\textless}0.01) with a trend toward shorter action potential duration. Whole-RNA sequencing of atrial tissue revealed disruption of the left-right axis, with the left atrium transcript profile of knockdown animals more closely resembling that of the control right atrium, and vice versa. Several genes important for sidedness were differentially expressed, including SFRP5, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling. SFRP5 was downregulated in the knockdown left atria (FDR=1.6 × 10-11) and upregulated in the knockdown right atria (FDR=1.1 × 10-12). Functional analysis further implicated differential control of the hedgehog signaling pathway as the most significantly enriched pathway for differentially expressed genes common to both atria (BH value=7.9 × 10-6), with global upregulation in the left atrium and downregulation in the right atrium. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes by atrium also revealed abnormalities in calcium ion binding and ion transmembrane transporter activity.{\textless}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Abstract 56 Figure 1" src="https://heart.bmj.com/content/heartjnl/104/Suppl\_7/A42/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="288"/{\textgreater}Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint Abstract 56 Figure 1 Structural and EP characteristics.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Late onset Alzheimer's disease is currently a disease with no known effective treatment options. To better understand disease, new multi-omic data-sets have recently been generated with the goal of identifying molecular causes of disease. However, most analytic studies using these datasets focus on uni-modal analysis of the data. Here, we propose a data driven approach to integrate multiple data types and analytic outcomes to aggregate evidences to support the hypothesis that a gene is a genetic driver of the disease. The main algorithmic contributions of our article are: (i) a general machine learning framework to learn the key characteristics of a few known driver genes from multiple feature sets and identifying other potential driver genes which have similar feature representations, and (ii) A flexible ranking scheme with the ability to integrate external validation in the form of Genome Wide Association Study summary statistics. While we currently focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach using different analytic outcomes from RNA-Seq studies, this method is easily generalizable to other data modalities and analysis types.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of our machine learning algorithm on two benchmark multiview datasets by significantly outperforming the baseline approaches in predicting missing labels. We then use the algorithm to predict and rank potential drivers of Alzheimer's. We show that our ranked genes show a significant enrichment for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Alzheimer's and are enriched in pathways that have been previously associated with the disease.

We launched the “Disease Module Identification DREAM Challenge”, an open competition to comprehensively assess module identification methods across diverse protein-protein interaction, signaling, gene co-expression, homology, and cancer-gene networks. Predicted network modules were tested for association with complex traits and diseases using a unique collection of 180 genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our critical assessment of 75 contributed module identification methods reveals novel top-performing algorithms, which recover complementary trait-associated modules.

	abstract = {Graphical models have proven to be a valuable tool for connecting genotypes and phenotypes. Structural learning of phenotype-genotype networks has received considerable attention in the post-genome era. In recent years, a dozen different methods have emerged for network inference, which leverage natural variation that arises in certain genetic populations. The structure of the network itself can be used to form hypotheses based on the inferred direct and indirect network relationships, but represents a premature endpoint to the graphical analyses. In this work, we extend this endpoint. We examine the unexplored problem of perturbing a given network structure, and quantifying the system-wide effects on the network in a node-wise manner. The perturbation is achieved through the setting of values of phenotype node(s), which may reflect an inhibition or activation, and propagating this information through the entire network. We leverage belief propagation methods in Conditional Gaussian Bayesian Networks (CG-BNs), in order to absorb and propagate phenotypic evidence through the network. We show that the modeling assumptions adopted for genotype-phenotype networks represent an important sub-class of CG-BNs, which possess properties that ensure exact inference in the propagation scheme. The system-wide effects of the perturbation are quantified in a node-wise manner through the comparison of perturbed and unperturbed marginal distributions using a symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence. Applications to kidney and skin cancer expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from different mus musculus populations are presented. System-wide effects in the network were predicted and visualized across a spectrum of evidence. Sub-pathways and regions of the network responded in concert, suggesting co-regulation and coordination throughout the network in response to phenotypic changes. We demonstrate how these predicted system-wide effects can be examined in connection with estimated class probabilities for covariates of interest, e.g. cancer status. Despite the uncertainty in the network structure, we demonstrate the system-wide predictions are stable across an ensemble of highly likely networks. A software package, geneNetBP, which implements our approach, was developed in the R programming language.},

Our study investigates the association of genetic risk for five common psychiatric disorders with socio-demographics, lifestyle and health of about 330,000 participants in the UK Biobank using a systematic, hypothesis-free approach. We found that genetic risk for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder were most strongly associated with lifestyle factors, such as time of first sexual intercourse and educational attainment. Genetic risks for autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia were associated with altered blood cell counts and time playing computer games, respectively. Increased genetic risk for depression was associated with other mental health outcomes such as neuroticism and irritability. In general, our results suggest that genetic risk for psychiatric disorders associates with a range of health and lifestyle traits that were measured in adulthood, in individuals from the general population who do not necessarily present with a psychiatric disorder diagnosis. However, it is important to note that these associations aren’t necessary causal but can themselves be influenced by other factors, like socio-economic factors and selection into the cohort. The findings inform future hypotheses to be tested using causally informative designs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic rating scales represent an important resource for standardized data collection. However, the ability to exploit reasoning on rating scale data is still limited. The objective of this work is to facilitate the integration of the semantics required to automatically interpret collections of standardized clinical data. We developed an electronic prototype for the Scale of the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), broadly used in neurology. In order to address the modeling challenges of the SARA, we propose to combine the best performances from OpenEHR clinical archetypes, guidelines and ontologies.
METHODS: A scaled-down version of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) was built, extracting the terms that describe the SARA tests from free-text sources. This version of the HPO was then used as backbone to normalize the content of the SARA through clinical archetypes. The knowledge required to exploit reasoning on the SARA data was modeled as separate information-processing units interconnected via the defined archetypes. Each unit used the most appropriate technology to formally represent the required knowledge.
RESULTS: Based on this approach, we implemented a prototype named SARA Management System, to be used for both the assessment of cerebellar syndrome and the production of a clinical synopsis. For validation purposes, we used recorded SARA data from 28 anonymous subjects affected by Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 36 (SCA36). When comparing the performance of our prototype with that of two independent experts, weighted kappa scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.86.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of archetypes, phenotype ontologies and electronic information-processing rules can be used to automate the extraction of relevant clinical knowledge from plain scores of rating scales. Our results reveal a substantial degree of agreement between the results achieved by an ontology-aware system and the human experts.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to create an ontology that will allow data integration and reasoning with subject data to classify subjects, and based on this classification, to infer new knowledge on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). We take a first step toward this goal by extending an existing autism ontology to allow automatic inference of ASD phenotypes and Diagnostic \& Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria based on subjects' Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessment data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Knowledge regarding diagnostic instruments, ASD phenotypes and risk factors was added to augment an existing autism ontology via Ontology Web Language class definitions and semantic web rules. We developed a custom Protégé plugin for enumerating combinatorial OWL axioms to support the many-to-many relations of ADI-R items to diagnostic categories in the DSM. We utilized a reasoner to infer whether 2642 subjects, whose data was obtained from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, meet DSM-IV-TR (DSM-IV) and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria based on their ADI-R data.
RESULTS: We extended the ontology by adding 443 classes and 632 rules that represent phenotypes, along with their synonyms, environmental risk factors, and frequency of comorbidities. Applying the rules on the data set showed that the method produced accurate results: the true positive and true negative rates for inferring autistic disorder diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria were 1 and 0.065, respectively; the true positive rate for inferring ASD based on DSM-5 criteria was 0.94.
DISCUSSION: The ontology allows automatic inference of subjects' disease phenotypes and diagnosis with high accuracy.
CONCLUSION: The ontology may benefit future studies by serving as a knowledge base for ASD. In addition, by adding knowledge of related NDDs, commonalities and differences in manifestations and risk factors could be automatically inferred, contributing to the understanding of ASD pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genes are often characterized dichotomously as either housekeeping or single-tissue specific. We conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression.
RESULTS: To obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mRNA expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62 839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. Indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index tau, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15{\textless} tau{\textless}0.85 were found to constitute {\textgreater}50\% of all expression patterns. We developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the I(B) tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12-I(B) tissues in which it shows low expression. The 85 dominant midrange patterns with I(B)=2-11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. Our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. Such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. These findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.

LOINC has not yet been semantically integrated with computational resources for phenotype analysis. Here, we provide a method for mapping LOINC-encoded laboratory test results transmitted in FHIR standards to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. We annotated the medical implications of 2923 commonly used laboratory tests with HPO terms. Using these annotations, our software assesses laboratory test results and converts each result into an HPO term. We validated our approach with EHR data from 15,681 patients with respiratory complaints and identified known biomarkers for asthma. Finally, we provide a freely available SMART on FHIR application that can be used within EHR systems. Our approach allows readily available laboratory tests in EHR to be reused for deep phenotyping and exploits the hierarchical structure of HPO to integrate distinct tests that have comparable medical interpretations for association studies.},

	abstract = {Disrupted circadian rhythms and reduced sleep duration are associated with several human diseases, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes, but until recently, little was known about the genetic factors influencing these heritable traits. We performed genome-wide association studies of self-reported chronotype (morning/evening person) and self-reported sleep duration in 128,266 white British individuals from the UK Biobank study. Sixteen variants were associated with chronotype (P{\textless}5x10-8), including variants near the known circadian rhythm genes RGS16 (1.21 odds of morningness, 95\% CI [1.15, 1.27], P = 3x10-12) and PER2 (1.09 odds of morningness, 95\% CI [1.06, 1.12], P = 4x10-10). The PER2 signal has previously been associated with iris function. We sought replication using self-reported data from 89,283 23andMe participants; thirteen of the chronotype signals remained associated at P{\textless}5x10-8 on meta-analysis and eleven of these reached P{\textless}0.05 in the same direction in the 23andMe study. We also replicated 9 additional variants identified when the 23andMe study was used as a discovery GWAS of chronotype (all P{\textless}0.05 and meta-analysis P{\textless}5x10-8). For sleep duration, we replicated one known signal in PAX8 (2.6 minutes per allele, 95\% CI [1.9, 3.2], P = 5.7x10-16) and identified and replicated two novel associations at VRK2 (2.0 minutes per allele, 95\% CI [1.3, 2.7], P = 1.2x10-9; and 1.6 minutes per allele, 95\% CI [1.1, 2.2], P = 7.6x10-9). Although we found genetic correlation between chronotype and BMI (rG = 0.056, P = 0.05); undersleeping and BMI (rG = 0.147, P = 1x10-5) and oversleeping and BMI (rG = 0.097, P = 0.04), Mendelian Randomisation analyses, with limited power, provided no consistent evidence of causal associations between BMI or type 2 diabetes and chronotype or sleep duration. Our study brings the total number of loci associated with chronotype to 22 and with sleep duration to three, and provides new insights into the biology of sleep and circadian rhythms in humans.},

	abstract = {What the cerebellum does to sensorimotor and vestibular control, it also does to cognition, emotion, and autonomic function. This hypothesis is based on the theories of dysmetria of thought and the universal cerebellar transform, which hold that the cerebellum maintains behavior around a homeostatic baseline, automatically, without conscious awareness, informed by implicit learning, and performed according to context. Functional topography within the cerebellum facilitates the modulation of distributed networks subserving multiple different functions. The sensorimotor cerebellum is represented in the anterior lobe with a second representation in lobule VIII, and lesions of these areas lead to the cerebellar motor syndrome of ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria and impaired oculomotor control. The cognitive / limbic cerebellum is in the cerebellar posterior lobe, with current evidence pointing to three separate topographic representations, the nature of which remain to be determined. Posterior lobe lesions result in the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS), the hallmark features of which include deficits in executive function, visual spatial processing, linguistic skills and regulation of affect. The affective dyscontrol manifests in autism spectrum and psychosis spectrum disorders, and disorders of emotional control, attentional control, and social skill set. This report presents an overview of the rapidly growing field of the clinical cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum. It commences with a brief historical background, then discusses tract tracing experiments in animal models and functional imaging observations in humans that subserve the cerebellar contribution to neurological function. Structure function correlation studies following focal cerebellar lesions in adults and children permit a finer appreciation of the functional topography and nature of the cerebellar motor syndrome, cerebellar vestibular syndrome, and the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology - the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. The ability to detect the CCAS in real time in clinical neurology with a brief and validated scale should make it possible to develop a deeper understanding of the clinical consequences of cerebellar lesions in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders with a link to the cerebellum.},

	abstract = {The cerebellum is a central brain structure deeply integrated into major loops with the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. The cerebellum shows a complex regional organization consisting of modules with sagittal orientation. The cerebellum takes part in motor control and its lesions cause a movement incoordination syndrome called ataxia. Recent observations also imply involvement of the cerebellum in cognition and executive control, with an impact on pathologies like dyslexia and autism. The cerebellum operates as a forward controller learning to predict the precise timing of correlated events. The physiologic mechanisms of cerebellar functioning are still the object of intense research. The signals entering the cerebellum through the mossy fibers are processed in the granular layer and transmitted to Purkinje cells, while a collateral pathway activates the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Purkinje cells in turn inhibit DCN, so that the cerebellar cortex operates as a side loop controlling the DCN. Learning is now known to occur through synaptic plasticity at multiple synapses in the granular layer, molecular layer, and DCN, extending the original concept of the Motor Learning Theory that predicted a single form of plasticity at the synapse between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells under the supervision of climbing fibers deriving from the inferior olive. Coordination derives from the precise regulation of timing and gain in the different cerebellar modules. The investigation of cerebellar dynamics using advanced physiologic recordings and computational models is now providing new clues on how the cerebellar network performs its internal computations.},

The use of various methodologies by myriad projects provides complementary types of information, ranging from easily quantifiable microarray data for gross brain regions, to transcript tag analysis and proteomic characterization. One mode of gene expression analysis that has recently been widely adopted is the utilization of colorimetric in situ hybridization. This approach is adaptable for high throughput production, and provides a reproducible, scaleable platform for large datasets. The Allen Brain Atlas in particular has utilized this technology to produce a genomic-scale anatomical digital atlas of gene expression in the adult male mouse brain. The availability of global datasets with cellular level spatial resolution, which can be easily parsed due to accessible informatics-derived image analysis tools, can provide both high level and detailed insights into gene regulation.

	abstract = {Large scale gene expression studies in the mammalian brain offer the promise of understanding the topology, networks and ultimately the function of its complex anatomy, opening previously unexplored avenues in neuroscience. High-throughput methods permit genome-wide searches to discover genes that are uniquely expressed in brain circuits and regions that control behavior. Previous gene expression mapping studies in model organisms have employed situ hybridization (ISH), a technique that uses labeled nucleic acid probes to bind to specific mRNA transcripts in tissue sections. A key requirement for this effort is the development of fast and robust algorithms for anatomically mapping and quantifying gene expression for ISH. We describe a neuroinformatics pipeline for automatically mapping expression profiles of ISH data and its use to produce the first genomic scale 3-D mapping of gene expression in a mammalian brain. The pipeline is fully automated and adaptable to other organisms and tissues. Our automated study of over 20,000 genes indicates that at least 78.8 percent are expressed at some level in the adult C56BL/6J mouse brain. In addition to providing a platform for genomic scale search, high-resolution images and visualization tools for expression analysis are available at the Allen Brain Atlas web site (http://www.brain-map.org).},

The hybridization products are detected by using a phosphatase-coupled antibody against digoxygenin. In parallel experiments, embryos can be treated with an antibody directed against the corresponding protein product to allow the detection of its distribution using standard immunochemical techniques. We have used this approach to compare the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the RNA and protein products of the segmentation gene hunchback (hb) during the early stages of embryogenesis. This comparison revealed translational control of the maternally derived hb mRNA, which was difficult to detect by conventional techniques. The non-radioactive in situ hybridization method is as sensitive as conventional methods, but is faster and easier to perform. This may make it a useful tool for a variety of other systems.},

	abstract = {We have developed a non-radioactive in situ hybridization technique for the localization of RNA in whole mount Drosophila embryos. After fixation, whole embryos are hybridized in situ with a DNA probe which has been labeled with digoxygenin. The hybridization products are detected by using a phosphatase-coupled antibody against digoxygenin. In parallel experiments, embryos can be treated with an antibody directed against the corresponding protein product to allow the detection of its distribution using standard immunochemical techniques. We have used this approach to compare the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the RNA and protein products of the segmentation gene hunchback (hb) during the early stages of embryogenesis. This comparison revealed translational control of the maternally derived hb mRNA, which was difficult to detect by conventional techniques. The non-radioactive in situ hybridization method is as sensitive as conventional methods, but is faster and easier to perform. This may make it a useful tool for a variety of other systems.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have become increasingly popular to identify associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypic traits. The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses.

Methods
We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/
)., In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual‐level scores of genetic risk.

Results
The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands‐on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users.

Conclusions
By providing theoretical background and hands‐on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

While intuitively appealing, this model may underestimate the biological complexity of common disease, and therefore, the goal to discover core genes should not guide experimental design. We consider other implications of polygenicity, concluding that a focus on patient stratification is needed to achieve the goals of precision medicine.},

We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways.

Inadequate consideration of these interactions may have hampered the progress on genome-wide association studies of alcohol dependence. By using the dataset of the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment with 3838 subjects, we conducted a genome-wide association studies of alcohol dependence symptom count (ADSC) with a full genetic model considering additive, dominance, epistasis and their interactions with ethnicity, as well as conditions of co-morbid substance dependence. Twenty quantitative trait single nucleotide polymorphisms (QTSs) showed highly significant associations with ADSC, including four previously reported genes (ADH1C, PKNOX2, CPE and KCNB2) and the reported intergenic rs1363605, supporting the overall validity of the analysis. Two QTSs within or near ADH1C showed very strong association in a dominance inheritance mode and increased the phenotype value of ADSC when the effect of co-morbid opiate or marijuana dependence was controlled. Highly significant association was also identified in variants within four novel genes (RGS6, FMN1, NRM and BPTF), two non-coding RNA and two epistasis loci. QTS rs7616413, located near PTPRG encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, interacted with rs10090742 within ANGPT1 encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase in an additive × additive or dominance × additive manner. The detected QTSs contributed to about 20 percent of total heritability, in which dominance and epistasis effects accounted for over 50 percent. These results demonstrated that perturbations arising from gene–gene interaction and conditions of co-morbidity substantially influence the genetic architecture of complex trait.},

The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case.

This perspective paper will discuss the known shortcomings of this standard approach using results obtained from the Human Microbiome Project. In particular, we will show that the traditional approach of using pairwise sequence alignments to compute sequence similarity can result in poorly clustered OTUs. As OTUs are typically annotated based upon a single representative sequence, poorly clustered OTUs can have significant impact on downstream analyses.

However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data.

As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, NOIseq and DESeq2. Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results.

However, individual genomic assays measure elements that interact in vivo as components of larger molecular machines. Understanding how these high-order interactions drive gene expression presents a substantial statistical challenge. Building on random forests (RFs) and random intersection trees (RITs) and through extensive, biologically inspired simulations, we developed the iterative random forest algorithm (iRF). iRF trains a feature-weighted ensemble of decision trees to detect stable, high-order interactions with the same order of computational cost as the RF. We demonstrate the utility of iRF for high-order interaction discovery in two prediction problems: enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of primary transcripts in human-derived cell lines. In Drosophila, among the 20 pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identifies as stable (returned in more than half of bootstrap replicates), 80\% have been previously reported as physical interactions. Moreover, third-order interactions, e.g., between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived cells, iRF rediscovered a central role of H3K36me3 in chromatin-mediated splicing regulation and identified interesting fifth- and sixth-order interactions, indicative of multivalent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing regulation. By decoupling the order of interactions from the computational cost of identification, iRF opens additional avenues of inquiry into the molecular mechanisms underlying genome biology.},

By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained.

Many computational experiments are difficult to apply exhaustively in network analysis due to run-times. To permit high-throughput analysis of gene networks, we have implemented a set of very efficient tools to calculate functional properties in networks based on guilt-by-association methods. ( xtending ' uilt-by- ssociation' by egree) allows gene networks to be evaluated with respect to hundreds or thousands of gene sets. The methods predict novel members of gene groups, assess how well a gene network groups known sets of genes, and determines the degree to which generic predictions drive performance. By allowing fast evaluations, whether of random sets or real functional ones, provides the user with an assessment of performance which can easily be used in controlled evaluations across many parameters.

	abstract = {Summary: Modelling biological associations or dependencies using linear regression is often complicated when the analyzed data-sets are high-dimensional and less observations than variables are available (n ≪ p). For genomic data-sets penalized regression methods have been applied settling this issue. Recently proposed regression models utilize prior knowledge on dependencies, e.g. in the form of graphs, arguing that this information will lead to more reliable estimates for regression coefficients. However, none of the proposed models for multivariate genomic response variables have been implemented as a computationally efficient, freely available library. In this paper we propose netReg, a package for graph-penalized regression models that use large networks and thousands of variables. netReg incorporates a priori generated biological graph information into linear models yielding sparse or smooth solutions for regression coefficients.

METHODS: A comprehensive and standardized review of the medical informatics literature was performed to select the most interesting papers of KRM published in 2017, based on a PubMed query.
RESULTS: In direct line with the research on data integration presented in the KRM section of the 2017 edition of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook, the five best papers for 2018 demonstrate even further the added-value of ontology-based integration approaches for phenotype-genotype association mining. Additionally, among the 15 preselected papers, two aspects of KRM are in the spotlight: the design of knowledge bases and new challenges in using ontologies.
CONCLUSIONS: Ontologies are demonstrating their maturity to integrate medical data and begin to support clinical practices. New challenges have emerged: the query on distributed semantically annotated datasets, the efficiency of semantic annotation processes, the semantic representation of large textual datasets, the control of biases associated with semantic annotations, and the computation of Bayesian indicators on data annotated with ontologies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prediction of human gene-abnormal phenotype associations is a fundamental step toward the discovery of novel genes associated with human disorders, especially when no genes are known to be associated with a specific disease. In this context the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standard categorization of the abnormalities associated with human diseases. While the problem of the prediction of gene-disease associations has been widely investigated, the related problem of gene-phenotypic feature (i.e., HPO term) associations has been largely overlooked, even if for most human genes no HPO term associations are known and despite the increasing application of the HPO to relevant medical problems. Moreover most of the methods proposed in literature are not able to capture the hierarchical relationships between HPO terms, thus resulting in inconsistent and relatively inaccurate predictions.
RESULTS: We present two hierarchical ensemble methods that we formally prove to provide biologically consistent predictions according to the hierarchical structure of the HPO. The modular structure of the proposed methods, that consists in a "flat" learning first step and a hierarchical combination of the predictions in the second step, allows the predictions of virtually any flat learning method to be enhanced. The experimental results show that hierarchical ensemble methods are able to predict novel associations between genes and abnormal phenotypes with results that are competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms and with a significant reduction of the computational complexity.
CONCLUSIONS: Hierarchical ensembles are efficient computational methods that guarantee biologically meaningful predictions that obey the true path rule, and can be used as a tool to improve and make consistent the HPO terms predictions starting from virtually any flat learning method. The implementation of the proposed methods is available as an R package from the CRAN repository.},

Using data from 85,760 individuals with activity-monitor derived measures of sleep timing we find that the chronotype loci associate with sleep timing: the mean sleep timing of the 5\% of individuals carrying the most morningness alleles is 25 min earlier than the 5\% carrying the fewest. The loci are enriched for genes involved in circadian regulation, cAMP, glutamate and insulin signalling pathways, and those expressed in the retina, hindbrain, hypothalamus, and pituitary.

	abstract = {Sleep disturbance, particularly insomnia, is common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Furthermore, disturbed sleep affects core symptoms and other related comorbidities. Understanding the causes and consequences of sleep disturbances in children with ASD is an important step toward mitigating these symptoms. To better understand the connection between sleep duration and ASD severity, we analyzed ASD-related symptoms using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), IQ scores, and parent reports of the average amount of time slept per night that were available in the medical histories of 2,714 children with ASD in the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). The mean (SD) sleep duration was 555 minutes. Sleep duration and severity of core ASD symptoms were negatively correlated, and sleep duration and IQ scores were positively correlated. Regression results indicated that more severe social impairment, primarily a failure to develop peer relationships, is the core symptom most strongly associated with short sleep duration. Furthermore, increased severity for numerous maladaptive behaviors assessed on the Child Behavior Checklist, as well as reports of attention deficit disorder, depressive disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder were associated with short sleep duration. Severity scores for social/communication impairment and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) were increased, and IQ scores were decreased, for children reported to sleep ≤420 minutes per night (lower 5th percentile) compared to children sleeping ≥660 minutes (upper 95th percentile). Our results indicate that reduced amounts of sleep are related to more severe symptoms in children with ASD. Autism Res 2017. © 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance is a frequent comorbidity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), affecting an estimated 40-80\% of cases. Previous reports have shown relationships between several circadian rhythm-related genes and sleep problems in ASD. The purpose of the present study was to relate variation in and around melatonin synthesis and suprachiasmatic nucleus genes to sleep problems in a large sample of children with ASD.
METHOD: This secondary analysis used existing genotypic and phenotypic data for 2,065 children, aged 4-18 years, from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). Sleep problems were measured with the SSC Sleep Interview. Expression quantitative trait loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms in 25 circadian genes were chosen primarily for their impact on expression levels of target genes in the brain. Associations between variants and composite sleep problems, nighttime problems, daytime problems, and sleep duration problems were calculated using logistic regression analysis. Age, sex, nonverbal IQ, ASD severity, gastrointestinal distress, seizures, and ancestry were included as covariates. Transmission disequilibrium tests were performed to test for overtransmission of alleles in the same variants.
RESULTS: No significant associations or transmission disequilibrium were found between gene variants and sleep problems in this sample of children with ASD.
CONCLUSION: Variation in expression of investigated genes in the melatonin synthesis and suprachiasmatic nucleus pathways did not have notable impacts on sleep problems in this large sample of children with ASD. Future research could explore translational and posttranslational effects of these genes or the effects of genes in other sleep-homeostasis pathways on sleep patterns.},

Existing methods for identifying genes with variants responsible for rare diseases summarize phenotypes with unstructured binary or quantitative variables. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) allows composite phenotypes to be represented systematically but association methods accounting for the ontological relationship between HPO terms do not exist. We present a Bayesian method to model the association between an HPO-coded patient phenotype and genotype. Our method estimates the probability of an association together with an HPO-coded phenotype characteristic of the disease. We thus formalize a clinical approach to phenotyping that is lacking in standard regression techniques for rare disease research.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We are currently facing a proliferation of heterogeneous biomedical data sources accessible through various knowledge-based applications. These data are annotated by increasingly extensive and widely disseminated knowledge organisation systems ranging from simple terminologies and structured vocabularies to formal ontologies. In order to solve the interoperability issue, which arises due to the heterogeneity of these ontologies, an alignment task is usually performed. However, while significant effort has been made to provide tools that automatically align small ontologies containing hundreds or thousands of entities, little attention has been paid to the matching of large sized ontologies in the life sciences domain.
RESULTS: We have designed and implemented ServOMap, an effective method for large scale ontology matching. It is a fast and efficient high precision system able to perform matching of input ontologies containing hundreds of thousands of entities. The system, which was included in the 2012 and 2013 editions of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative campaign, performed very well. It was ranked among the top systems for the large ontologies matching.
CONCLUSIONS: We proposed an approach for large scale ontology matching relying on Information Retrieval (IR) techniques and the combination of lexical and machine learning contextual similarity computing for the generation of candidate mappings. It is particularly adapted to the life sciences domain as many of the ontologies in this domain benefit from synonym terms taken from the Unified Medical Language System and that can be used by our IR strategy. The ServOMap system we implemented is able to deal with hundreds of thousands entities with an efficient computation time.},

Disease and phenotype ontologies are important for applications such as data mining, data integration and knowledge management to support translational science in drug discovery and understanding the genetics of disease.
RESULTS: Eleven systems (out of 21 OAEI participating systems) were able to cope with at least one of the tasks in the Disease and Phenotype track. AML, FCA-Map, LogMap(Bio) and PhenoMF systems produced the top results for ontology matching in comparison to consensus alignments. The results against manually curated mappings proved to be more difficult most likely because these mapping sets comprised mostly subsumption relationships rather than equivalence. Manual assessment of unique equivalence mappings showed that AML, LogMap(Bio) and PhenoMF systems have the highest precision results.
CONCLUSIONS: Four systems gave the highest performance for matching disease and phenotype ontologies. These systems coped well with the detection of equivalence matches, but struggled to detect semantic similarity. This deserves more attention in the future development of ontology matching systems. The findings of this evaluation show that such systems could help to automate equivalence matching in the workflow of curators, who maintain ontology mapping services in numerous domains such as disease and phenotype.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The goal of ontology matching is to identify correspondences between entities from different yet overlapping ontologies so as to facilitate semantic integration, reuse and interoperability. As a well developed mathematical model for analyzing individuals and structuring concepts, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) has been applied to ontology matching (OM) tasks since the beginning of OM research, whereas ontological knowledge exploited in FCA-based methods is limited. This motivates the study in this paper, i.e., to empower FCA with as much as ontological knowledge as possible for identifying mappings across ontologies.
METHODS: We propose a method based on Formal Concept Analysis to identify and validate mappings across ontologies, including one-to-one mappings, complex mappings and correspondences between object properties. Our method, called FCA-Map, incrementally generates a total of five types of formal contexts and extracts mappings from the lattices derived. First, the token-based formal context describes how class names, labels and synonyms share lexical tokens, leading to lexical mappings (anchors) across ontologies. Second, the relation-based formal context describes how classes are in taxonomic, partonomic and disjoint relationships with the anchors, leading to positive and negative structural evidence for validating the lexical matching. Third, the positive relation-based context can be used to discover structural mappings. Afterwards, the property-based formal context describes how object properties are used in axioms to connect anchor classes across ontologies, leading to property mappings. Last, the restriction-based formal context describes co-occurrence of classes across ontologies in anonymous ancestors of anchors, from which extended structural mappings and complex mappings can be identified.
RESULTS: Evaluation on the Anatomy, the Large Biomedical Ontologies, and the Disease and Phenotype track of the 2016 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative campaign demonstrates the effectiveness of FCA-Map and its competitiveness with the top-ranked systems. FCA-Map can achieve a better balance between precision and recall for large-scale domain ontologies through constructing multiple FCA structures, whereas it performs unsatisfactorily for smaller-sized ontologies with less lexical and semantic expressions.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other FCA-based OM systems, the study in this paper is more comprehensive as an attempt to push the envelope of the Formal Concept Analysis formalism in ontology matching tasks. Five types of formal contexts are constructed incrementally, and their derived concept lattices are used to cluster the commonalities among classes at lexical and structural level, respectively. Experiments on large, real-world domain ontologies show promising results and reveal the power of FCA.},

In recent years, large-scale phenotype studies such as Phenoscape and EuroPhenome have been initiated to identify genetic causes of a species' phenome. Species-specific phenotype ontologies are required to capture and report about all findings and to automatically infer results relevant to human diseases. The integration of the different phenotype ontologies into a coherent framework is necessary to achieve interoperability for cross-species research.Here, we investigate the quality and completeness of two different methods to align the Human Phenotype Ontology and the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology. The first method combines lexical matching with inference over the ontologies' taxonomic structures, while the second method uses a mapping algorithm based on the formal definitions of the ontologies. Neither method could map all concepts. Despite the formal definitions method provides mappings for more concepts than does the lexical matching method, it does not outperform the lexical matching in a biological use case. Our results suggest that combining both approaches will yield a better mappings in terms of completeness, specificity and application purposes.},

Importantly, the ontology contains broad and specific terms, facilitating annotation of data from initial observations or screens and detailed data from subsequent experimental research. Using the ontology structure, data are retrieved inclusively, i.e., data annotated to chosen terms and to terms subordinate in the hierarchy. Thus, searching for "abnormal craniofacial morphology" also returns annotations to "megacephaly" and "microcephaly," more specific terms in the hierarchy path. The development and refinement of the MP is ongoing, with new terms and modifications to its organization undergoing continuous assessment as users and expert reviewers propose expansions and revisions. A wealth of phenotype data on mouse mutations and variants annotated to the MP already exists in the Mouse Genome Informatics database. These data, along with data curated to the MP by many mouse mutagenesis programs and mouse repositories, provide a platform for comparative analyses and correlative discoveries. The MP provides a standard underpinning to mouse phenotype descriptions for existing and future experimental and large-scale phenotyping projects. In this review we describe the MP as it presently exists, its application to phenotype annotations, the relationship of the MP to other ontologies, and the integration of the MP within large-scale phenotyping projects. Finally we discuss future application of the MP in providing standard descriptors of the phenotype pipeline test results from the International Mouse Phenotype Consortium projects.},

It is critical that this information is captured in a standardized manner, made accessible, and is fully integrated with other phenotype data sets for comprehensive querying and analysis across all phenotype data types. The volume of data generated by the high-throughput phenotyping screens is expected to grow exponentially, thus, automated methods and standards to exchange phenotype data are required.
RESULTS: The IMPC (International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium) is using the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology in the automated annotation of phenodeviant data from high throughput phenotyping screens. 287 new term additions with additional hierarchy revisions were made in multiple branches of the MP ontology to accurately describe the results generated by these high throughput screens.
CONCLUSIONS: Because these large scale phenotyping data sets will be reported using the MP as the common data standard for annotation and data exchange, automated importation of these data to MGI (Mouse Genome Informatics) and other resources is possible without curatorial effort. Maximum biomedical value of these mutant mice will come from integrating primary high-throughput phenotyping data with secondary, comprehensive phenotypic analyses combined with published phenotype details on these and related mutants at MGI and other resources.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic forms of ataxia are a heterogenous group of degenerative diseases of the cerebellum. Many causative genes have been identified. We aimed to systematically investigate these genes to better understand ataxia pathophysiology.
METHODS: A manually curated catalogue of 71 genes involved in disorders with progressive ataxias as a major clinical feature was subjected to an integrated gene ontology, protein network and brain gene expression profiling analysis.
RESULTS: We found that genes mutated in ataxias operate in networks with significantly enriched protein connectivity, demonstrating coherence on a global level, independent of inheritance mode. Moreover, elevated expression specifically in the cerebellum predisposes to ataxia. Genes expressed in this pattern are significantly over-represented among genes mutated in ataxia and are enriched for ion homeostasis/synaptic functions. The majority of genes mutated in ataxia, however, does not show elevated cerebellar expression that could account for region-specific degeneration. For these, we identified defective cellular stress responses as a major common biological theme, suggesting that the defence pathways against stress are more critical to maintain cerebellar integrity than integrity of other brain regions. Approximately half of the genes mutated in ataxia, mostly part of the stress module, show higher expression at embryonic stages, which argues for a developmental predisposition.
CONCLUSION: Genetic defects in ataxia predominantly affect neuronal homeostasis, to which the cerebellum appears to be excessively susceptible. Based on the identified modules, it is conceivable to propose common therapeutic interventions that target deregulated calcium and reactive oxygen species levels, or mechanisms that can decrease the harmful downstream effects of these deleterious insults.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the relationship between HbA1c and glucose in people with co-existing liver disease and diabetes awaiting transplant, and in those with diabetes but no liver disease.
METHODS: HbA1c and random plasma glucose data were collected for 125 people with diabetes without liver disease and for 29 people awaiting liver transplant with diabetes and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, hereditary haemochromatosis, polycystic liver/kidneys, cryptogenic/non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and α-1-antitrypsin-related disease.
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) age of the diabetes with cirrhosis group was 55 (49-63) years compared to 60 (50-71) years (P=0.13) in the group without cirrhosis. In the diabetes with cirrhosis group there were 21 men (72\%) compared with 86 men (69\%) in the group with diabetes and no cirrhosis (P=0.82). Of the group with diabetes and cirrhosis, 27 people (93\%) were of white European ethnicity, two (7\%) were South Asian and none was of Afro-Caribbean/other ethnicity compared with 94 (75\%), 16 (13\%), 10 (8\%)/5 (4\%), respectively, in the group with diabetes and no cirrhosis (P=0.20). Median (interquartile range) HbA1c was 41 (32-56) mmol/mol [5.9 (5.1-7.3)\%] vs 61 (52-70) mmol/mol [7.7 (6.9-8.6)\%] (P{\textless}0.001), respectively, in the diabetes with cirrhosis group vs the diabetes without cirrhosis group. The glucose concentrations were 8.4 (7.0-11.2) mmol/l vs 7.3 (5.2-11.5) mmol/l (P=0.17). HbA1c was depressed by 20 mmol/mol (1.8\%; P{\textless}0.001) in 28 participants with cirrhosis but elevated by 28 mmol/mol (2.6\%) in the participant with α-1-antitrypsin disorder. Those with cirrhosis and depressed HbA1c had fewer larger erythrocytes, and higher red cell distribution width and reticulocyte count. This was reflected in the positive association of glucose with mean cell volume (r=0.39) and haemoglobin level (r=0.49) and the negative association for HbA1c (r=-0.28 and r=-0.26, respectively) in the diabetes group with cirrhosis.
CONCLUSION: HbA1c is not an appropriate test for blood glucose in people with cirrhosis and diabetes awaiting transplant as it reflects altered erythrocyte presentation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Translational medicine (TM) is an emerging domain that aims to facilitate medical or biological advances efficiently from the scientist to the clinician. Central to the TM vision is to narrow the gap between basic science and applied science in terms of time, cost and early diagnosis of the disease state. Biomarker identification is one of the main challenges within TM. The identification of disease biomarkers from -omics data will not only help the stratification of diverse patient cohorts but will also provide early diagnostic information which could improve patient management and potentially prevent adverse outcomes. However, biomarker identification needs to be robust and reproducible. Hence a robust unbiased computational framework that can help clinicians identify those biomarkers is necessary.
METHODS: We developed a pipeline (workflow) that includes two different supervised classification techniques based on regularization methods to identify biomarkers from -omics or other high dimension clinical datasets. The pipeline includes several important steps such as quality control and stability of selected biomarkers. The process takes input files (outcome and independent variables or -omics data) and pre-processes (normalization, missing values) them. After a random division of samples into training and test sets, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Elastic Net feature selection methods are applied to identify the most important features representing potential biomarker candidates. The penalization parameters are optimised using 10-fold cross validation and the process undergoes 100 iterations and a combinatorial analysis to select the best performing multivariate model. An empirical unbiased assessment of their quality as biomarkers for clinical use is performed through a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and its Area Under the Curve analysis on both permuted and real data for 1000 different randomized training and test sets. We validated this pipeline against previously published biomarkers.
RESULTS: We applied this pipeline to three different datasets with previously published biomarkers: lipidomics data by Acharjee et al. (Metabolomics 13:25, 2017) and transcriptomics data by Rajamani and Bhasin (Genome Med 8:38, 2016) and Mills et al. (Blood 114:1063-1072, 2009). Our results demonstrate that our method was able to identify both previously published biomarkers as well as new variables that add value to the published results.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a robust pipeline to identify clinically relevant biomarkers that can be applied to different -omics datasets. Such identification reveals potentially novel drug targets and can be used as a part of a machine-learning based patient stratification framework in the translational medicine settings.},

	abstract = {Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are frequently co-occurring neurodevelopmental disorders and affect 2-3\% of the population. Rapid advances in exome and genome sequencing have increased the number of known implicated genes by threefold, to more than a thousand. The main challenges in the field are now to understand the various pathomechanisms associated with this bewildering number of genetic disorders, to identify new genes and to establish causality of variants in still-undiagnosed cases, and to work towards causal treatment options that so far are available only for a few metabolic conditions. To meet these challenges, the research community needs highly efficient model systems. With an increasing number of relevant assays and rapidly developing novel methodologies, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is ideally positioned to change gear in ID and ASD research. The aim of this Review is to summarize some of the exciting work that already has drawn attention to Drosophila as a model for these disorders. We highlight well-established ID- and ASD-relevant fly phenotypes at the (sub)cellular, brain and behavioral levels, and discuss strategies of how this extraordinarily efficient and versatile model can contribute to 'next generation' medical genomics and to a better understanding of these disorders.},

A large body of work has reported neuroanatomical differences between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls. Despite the huge clinical and genetic heterogeneity that typifies autism, some of these anatomical features appear to be either present in most cases or so dramatically altered in some that their presence is now reasonably well replicated in a number of studies. One such finding is the tendency towards overgrowth of the frontal cortex during the early postnatal period. Although these reports have been focused primarily on the presumed pathological anatomy, they are providing us with important insights into normal brain anatomy and are stimulating new ideas and hypotheses about the normal trajectory of brain development and the function of specific anatomical brain structures. The use of model systems that include genetic model organisms such as the mouse and, more recently, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids to model normal and pathological human cortical development, is proving particularly informative. Here we review some of the neuroanatomical alterations reported in autism, with a particular focus on well-validated findings and recent advances in the field, and ask what these observations can tell us about normal and abnormal brain development.},

We present an implementation of Pearson correlation calculation that can lead to substantial speedup on data with relatively small number of missing entries. Further, we parallelize all calculations and thus achieve further speedup on systems where parallel processing is available. A robust correlation measure, the biweight midcorrelation, is implemented in a similar manner and provides comparable speed. The functions cor and bicor for fast Pearson and biweight midcorrelation, respectively, are part of the updated, freely available R package WGCNA., The hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in R function hclust is an order n3 (n is the number of clustered objects) version of a publicly available clustering algorithm ().

In this study, we systematically evaluated the genetic basis of 38 blood and urine laboratory tests measured in 358,072 participants in the UK Biobank and identified 1,857 independent loci associated with at least one laboratory test, including 488 large-effect protein truncating, missense, and copy-number variants. We tested these loci for enrichment in specific single cell types in kidney, liver, and pancreas relevant to disease aetiology. We then causally linked the biomarkers to medically relevant phenotypes through genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization. Finally, we developed polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each biomarker and built multi-PRS models using all 38 PRSs simultaneously. We found substantially improved prediction of incidence in FinnGen (n=135,500) with the multi-PRS relative to single-disease PRSs for renal failure, myocardial infarction, liver fat percentage, and alcoholic cirrhosis. Together, our results show the genetic basis of these biomarkers, which tissues contribute to the biomarker function, the causal influences of the biomarkers, and how we can use this to predict disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional one variant-one phenotype association study. Here we introduce a model comparison approach we refer to as MRP for rare variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and location of genetic effects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. We consider the use of summary statistic data to apply univariate and multivariate gene-based meta-analysis models for identifying rare variant associations with an emphasis on protective protein-truncating variants that can expedite drug discovery. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed model comparison approach can improve ability to detect rare variant association signals. We also apply the model to two groups of phenotypes from the UK Biobank: 1) asthma diagnosis (43,626 cases), eosinophil counts, forced expiratory volume, and forced vital capacity; and 2) glaucoma diagnosis (5,863 cases), intra-ocular pressure, and corneal resistance factor. We are able to recover known associations such as the protective association between rs146597587 in \textit{IL33} and asthma (log$_{\textrm{10}}$ (Bayes Factor) = 29.4). We also find evidence for novel protective associations between rare variants in \textit{ANGPTL7} and glaucoma (log$_{\textrm{10}}$ (Bayes Factor) = 13.1). Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to retain and improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches for rare variant association analyses and prioritize protective modifiers of disease risk.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Author summary{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Due to the continually decreasing cost of acquiring genetic data, we are now beginning to see large collections of individuals for which we have both genetic information and trait data such as disease status, physical measurements, biomarker levels, and more. These datasets offer new opportunities to find relationships between inherited genetic variation and disease. While it is known that there are relationships between different traits, typical genetic analyses only focus on analyzing one genetic variant and one phenotype at a time. Additionally, it is difficult to identify rare genetic variants that are associated with disease due to their scarcity, even among large sample sizes. In this work, we present a method for identifying associations between genetic variation and disease that considers multiple rare variants and phenotypes at the same time. By sharing information across rare variant and phenotypes, we improve our ability to identify rare variants associated with disease compared to considering a single rare variant and a single phenotype. The method can be used to identify candidate disease genes as well as genes that might represent attractive drug targets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Migraine is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over a dozen genetic loci associated with migraine. Here, we integrated migraine GWAS data with high-resolution spatial gene expression data of normal adult brains from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to identify specific brain regions and molecular pathways that are possibly involved in migraine pathophysiology. To this end, we used two complementary methods. In GWAS data from 23,285 migraine cases and 95,425 controls, we first studied modules of co-expressed genes that were calculated based on human brain expression data for enrichment of genes that showed association with migraine. Enrichment of a migraine GWAS signal was found for five modules that suggest involvement in migraine pathophysiology of: (i) neurotransmission, protein catabolism and mitochondria in the cortex; (ii) transcription regulation in the cortex and cerebellum; and (iii) oligodendrocytes and mitochondria in subcortical areas. Second, we used the high-confidence genes from the migraine GWAS as a basis to construct local migraine-related co-expression gene networks. Signatures of all brain regions and pathways that were prominent in the first method also surfaced in the second method, thus providing support that these brain regions and pathways are indeed involved in migraine pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic epistasis is an often-overlooked area in the study of the genomics of complex traits. Genome-wide association studies are a useful tool for revealing potential causal genetic variants, but in this context, epistasis is generally ignored. Data complexity and interpretation issues make it difficult to process and interpret epistasis. As the number of interaction grows exponentially with the number of variants, computational limitation is a bottleneck. Gene Network based strategies have been successful in integrating biological data and identifying relevant hub genes and pathways related to complex traits. In this study, epistatic interactions and network-based analysis are combined in the Weighted Interaction SNP hub (WISH) method and implemented in an efficient and easy to use R package.
RESULTS: The WISH R package (WISH-R) was developed to calculate epistatic interactions on a genome-wide level based on genomic data. It is easy to use and install, and works on regular genomic data. The package filters data based on linkage disequilibrium and calculates epistatic interaction coefficients between SNP pairs based on a parallelized efficient linear model and generalized linear model implementations. Normalized epistatic coefficients are analyzed in a network framework, alleviating multiple testing issues and integrating biological signal to identify modules and pathways related to complex traits. Functions for visualizing results and testing runtimes are also provided.
CONCLUSION: The WISH-R package is an efficient implementation for analyzing genome-wide epistasis for complex diseases and traits. It includes methods and strategies for analyzing epistasis from initial data filtering until final data interpretation. WISH offers a new way to analyze genomic data by combining epistasis and network based analysis in one method and provides options for visualizations. This alleviates many of the existing hurdles in the analysis of genomic interactions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput genotype (HTG) data has been used primarily in genome-wide association (GWA) studies; however, GWA results explain only a limited part of the complete genetic variation of traits. In systems genetics, network approaches have been shown to be able to identify pathways and their underlying causal genes to unravel the biological and genetic background of complex diseases and traits, e.g., the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method based on microarray gene expression data. The main objective of this study was to develop a scale-free weighted genetic interaction network method using whole genome HTG data in order to detect biologically relevant pathways and potential genetic biomarkers for complex diseases and traits.
RESULTS: We developed the Weighted Interaction SNP Hub (WISH) network method that uses HTG data to detect genome-wide interactions between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and its relationship with complex traits. Data dimensionality reduction was achieved by selecting SNPs based on its: 1) degree of genome-wide significance and 2) degree of genetic variation in a population. Network construction was based on pairwise Pearson's correlation between SNP genotypes or the epistatic interaction effect between SNP pairs. To identify modules the Topological Overlap Measure (TOM) was calculated, reflecting the degree of overlap in shared neighbours between SNP pairs. Modules, clusters of highly interconnected SNPs, were defined using a tree-cutting algorithm on the SNP dendrogram created from the dissimilarity TOM (1-TOM). Modules were selected for functional annotation based on their association with the trait of interest, defined by the Genome-wide Module Association Test (GMAT). We successfully tested the established WISH network method using simulated and real SNP interaction data and GWA study results for carcass weight in a pig resource population; this resulted in detecting modules and key functional and biological pathways related to carcass weight.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed the WISH network method which is a novel 'systems genetics' approach to study genetic networks underlying complex trait variation. The WISH network method reduces data dimensionality and statistical complexity in associating genotypes with phenotypes in GWA studies and enables researchers to identify biologically relevant pathways and potential genetic biomarkers for any complex trait of interest.},

	abstract = {Sleep disturbance, particularly insomnia, is common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Furthermore, disturbed sleep affects core symptoms and other related comorbidities. Understanding the causes and consequences of sleep disturbances in children with ASD is an important step toward mitigating these symptoms. To better understand the connection between sleep duration and ASD severity, we analyzed ASD-related symptoms using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), IQ scores, and parent reports of the average amount of time slept per night that were available in the medical histories of 2,714 children with ASD in the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). The mean (SD) sleep duration was 555 minutes. Sleep duration and severity of core ASD symptoms were negatively correlated, and sleep duration and IQ scores were positively correlated. Regression results indicated that more severe social impairment, primarily a failure to develop peer relationships, is the core symptom most strongly associated with short sleep duration. Furthermore, increased severity for numerous maladaptive behaviors assessed on the Child Behavior Checklist, as well as reports of attention deficit disorder, depressive disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder were associated with short sleep duration. Severity scores for social/communication impairment and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) were increased, and IQ scores were decreased, for children reported to sleep ≤420 minutes per night (lower 5th percentile) compared to children sleeping ≥660 minutes (upper 95th percentile). Our results indicate that reduced amounts of sleep are related to more severe symptoms in children with ASD. Autism Res 2017. © 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To evaluate treatments for sleep disturbance in this population, it is critical to understand the relationship between measures of sleep captured by parent report and objective measures. The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and actigraphy-measured data from 80 children with autism and sleep-onset delay were evaluated. Reported problems with sleep-onset delay were concurrent with sleep duration problems in 66\% of children, night wakings in 72\% of children, and bedtime resistance in 66\% of children; 38\% of children were reported to have problems with all CSHQ insomnia domains. Actigraphy-measured sleep duration was correlated with estimates using CSHQ-reported bed and wake times.},

An analysis of spatial transcriptome trajectories across eight brain regions in four primate species revealed 1,851 genes showing human-specific transcriptome differences in one or multiple brain regions, in contrast to 240 chimpanzee-specific ones. More than half of these human-specific differences represented elevated expression of genes enriched in neuronal and astrocytic markers in the human hippocampus, while the rest were enriched in microglial markers and displayed human-specific expression in several frontal cortical regions and the cerebellum. An analysis of the predicted regulatory interactions driving these differences revealed the role of transcription factors in species-specific transcriptome changes, while epigenetic modifications were linked to spatial expression differences conserved across species.},

	abstract = {Understanding the core set of genes that are necessary for basic developmental functions is one of the central goals in biology. Studies in model organisms identified a significant fraction of essential genes through the analysis of null-mutations that lead to lethality. Recent large-scale next-generation sequencing efforts have provided unprecedented data on genetic variation in human. However, evolutionary and genomic characteristics of human essential genes have never been directly studied on a genome-wide scale. Here we use detailed phenotypic resources available for the mouse and deep genomics sequencing data from human populations to characterize patterns of genetic variation and mutational burden in a set of 2,472 human orthologs of known essential genes in the mouse. Consistent with the action of strong, purifying selection, these genes exhibit comparatively reduced levels of sequence variation, skew in allele frequency towards more rare, and exhibit increased conservation across the primate and rodent lineages relative to the remainder of genes in the genome. In individual genomes we observed ∼12 rare mutations within essential genes predicted to be damaging. Consistent with the hypothesis that mutations in essential genes are risk factors for neurodevelopmental disease, we show that de novo variants in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder are more likely to occur in this collection of genes. While incomplete, our set of human orthologs shows characteristics fully consistent with essential function in human and thus provides a resource to inform and facilitate interpretation of sequence data in studies of human disease.},

	abstract = {Objective: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening can improve prognosis via early diagnosis and intervention, but lack of time and training can deter pediatric screening. The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (M-CHAT-R) is a widely used screener but requires follow-up questions and error-prone human scoring and interpretation. We consider an automated machine learning (ML) method for overcoming barriers to ASD screening, specifically using the feedforward neural network (fNN).
        Methods: The fNN technique was applied using archival M-CHAT-R data of 14,995 toddlers (age 16–30 months, 46.51\% male). The 20 M-CHAT-R items were inputs, and ASD diagnosis after follow-up and diagnostic evaluation (i.e., ASD or not ASD) was the output. The sample was divided into subgroups by race (i.e., white and black), sex (i.e., boys and girls), and maternal education (i.e., below and above 15 years of education completed) to examine subgroup differences. Each subgroup was evaluated for best-performing fNN models.
        Results: For the total sample, best results yielded 99.72\% correct classification using 18 items. Best results yielded 99.92\% correct classification using 14 items for white toddlers and 99.79\% correct classification using 18 items for black toddlers. In boys, best results yielded 99.64\% correct classification using 18 items, whereas best results yielded 99.95\% correct classification using 18 items in girls. For the case when maternal education is 15 years or less (i.e., associate degree and below), best results were 99.75\% correct classification when using 16 items. Results were essentially the same when maternal education was 16 years or more (i.e., above associate degree); that is, 99.70\% correct classification was obtained using 16 items.
        Conclusion: The ML method was comparable to the M-CHAT-R with follow-up items in accuracy of ASD diagnosis while using fewer items. Therefore, ML may be a beneficial tool in implementing automatic, efficient scoring that negates the need for labor-intensive follow-up and circumvents human error, providing an advantage over previous screening methods.},

Research indicates that aggression rates may be higher in individuals with ASD compared to those with other developmental disabilities. Aggression is associated with negative outcomes for children with ASD and their caregivers, including decreased quality of life, increased stress levels, and reduced availability of educational and social support. Therapeutic strategies including functional behavioral assessment, reinforcement strategies, and functional communication training may have a significant impact in reducing the frequency and intensity of aggressive behavior in individuals with ASD. Pharmacologic treatments, particularly the use of second-generation antipsychotics, may also be of some benefit in reducing aggression in individuals with ASD. With the ever-increasing rate of ASD diagnosis, development of effective therapeutic and pharmacologic methods for preventing and treating aggression are essential to improving outcomes in this disorder.},

Data were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), consisting of 20 social competence items and 118 behavior problems. Parents of 1,300 referred children completed the CBCL at intake into outpatient mental health services, while parents of 1,300 randomly selected nonreferred children completed the CBCL in a home interview survey. Intraclass correlations were in the .90s for interparent agreement, 1-week test-retest reliability, and inter-interviewer reliability. Indices of the reported prevalence of each item are graphically portrayed for children grouped by age, gender, and clinical status. Multiple regressions and ANCOVAs showed minimal racial differences but significant tendencies for lower SES children to have higher behavior problem and lower competence scores than upper SES children. There were numerous gender differences on specific items but no significant gender difference in total behavior problem or competence score. Age showed more and larger differences than the other demographic variables, but these differences were dwarfed by differences related to referral status. Across all demographic groups, referal status accounted for more variance in total behavior problem and social competence scores than in the scores for any single item. However, some behavior problems that have traditionally received little attention were much more strongly associated with referral status than problems that have received much attention. Cutoff points on the distributions of total behavior problem and social competence scores yield good separation between referred and nonreferred samples.},

Children (M = 25.34 months, SD = 1.04) wore an actigraph monitor (Mini-Mitter® Actiwatch Actigraph, Respironics) for a 72-hour period, and mothers completed a sleep diary during the same period. 89\% of the mothers and 75 \% of the fathers also filled out the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/1.5-5). Mother and father CBCL scores were highly correlated. Overall, good correspondence was found between the CBCL filled out by mothers and sleep efficiency and duration derived from maternal sleep diaries (r between -.39 and -.25, p ≤ .05). Good correspondence was also found between the CBCL filled out by fathers and sleep efficiency as derived from maternal sleep diaries (r between -.39 and -.24, p ≤ .05), but not with sleep duration (all results were non-significant). Very few correlations between actigraphy and the CLBL scores reached statistical significance. The Bland and Altman method revealed that sleep diaries and actigraphy showed poor agreement with one another when assessing sleep duration and sleep efficiency. However, diary- and actigraphy-derived sleep durations were significantly correlated. Consistent with findings among older groups of children, this study suggests that the CBCL sleep items, sleep diaries, and actigraphy tap into quite different aspects of sleep among toddlers. The choice of which measures to use should be based on the exact aspects of sleep that one aims to assess. Overall, despite its frequent use, the composite sleep score of the CBCL shows poor links to objective measures of sleep duration and sleep efficiency.},

	abstract = {Objective
The Child Behavior Checklist is sometimes used to assess sleep disturbance despite not having been validated for this purpose. This study examined associations between the Child Behavior Checklist sleep items and other measures of sleep.

Method
Participants were 122 youth (61\% female, aged 7 through 17 years) with anxiety disorders (19\%), major depressive disorder (9\%), both anxiety and depression (26\%), or a negative history of any psychiatric disorder (46\%). Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and children completed a sleep diary, wore actigraphs for multiple nights, and spent 2 nights in the sleep laboratory. Partial correlations ([pr], controlling for age, gender and diagnostic status) were used to examine associations.

Results
Child Behavior Checklist sleep items were associated with several other sleep variables. For example, “trouble sleeping” correlated significantly with sleep latency assessed by both diary (pr(113) = 0.25, p = .008) and actigraphy (pr(105) = 0.21, p = .029). Other expected associations were not found (e.g., “sleeps more than most kids” was not significantly correlated with EEG-assessed total sleep time: pr(84) = 0.12, p = .258).

Conclusions
Assessing sleep using the Child Behavior Checklist exclusively is not ideal. Nonetheless, certain Child Behavior Checklist items (e.g., “trouble sleeping”) may be valuable. Although the Child Behavior Checklist may provide a means of examining some aspects of sleep from existing datasets that do not include other measures of sleep, hypotheses generated from such analyses need to be tested using more rigorous measures of sleep.},

We apply univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs explained 17–29\% of the variance in liability. The genetic correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 ± 0.04 s.e.), moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (0.43 ± 0.06 s.e.), bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (0.47 ± 0.06 s.e.), and ADHD and major depressive disorder (0.32 ± 0.07 s.e.), low between schizophrenia and ASD (0.16 ± 0.06 s.e.) and non-significant for other pairs of disorders as well as between psychiatric disorders and the negative control of Crohn's disease.

	abstract = {Background Community samples suggest that approximately 1 in 20 children and adults exhibit clinically significant anger, hostility, and aggression. Individuals with dysregulated emotional control have a greater lifetime burden of psychiatric morbidity, severe impairment in role functioning, and premature mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Methods With publically available data secured from dbGaP, we conducted a genome-wide association study of proneness to anger using the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Scale in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (n = 8,747). Results Subjects were, on average, 54 (range 45–64) years old at baseline enrollment, 47\% (n = 4,117) were male, and all were of European descent by self-report. The mean Angry Temperament and Angry Reaction scores were 5.8±1.8 and 7.6±2.2. We observed a nominally significant finding (p = 2.9E-08, λ = 1.027 - corrected pgc = 2.2E-07, λ = 1.0015) on chromosome 6q21 in the gene coding for the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Fyn. Conclusions Fyn interacts with NDMA receptors and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-gated channels to regulate calcium influx and intracellular release in the post-synaptic density. These results suggest that signaling pathways regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis, which are relevant to memory, learning, and neuronal survival, may in part underlie the expression of Angry Temperament.},

Migraine is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over a dozen genetic loci associated with migraine. Here, we integrated migraine GWAS data with high-resolution spatial gene expression data of normal adult brains from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to identify specific brain regions and molecular pathways that are possibly involved in migraine pathophysiology. To this end, we used two complementary methods. In GWAS data from 23,285 migraine cases and 95,425 controls, we first studied modules of co-expressed genes that were calculated based on human brain expression data for enrichment of genes that showed association with migraine. Enrichment of a migraine GWAS signal was found for five modules that suggest involvement in migraine pathophysiology of: (i) neurotransmission, protein catabolism and mitochondria in the cortex; (ii) transcription regulation in the cortex and cerebellum; and (iii) oligodendrocytes and mitochondria in subcortical areas. Second, we used the high-confidence genes from the migraine GWAS as a basis to construct local migraine-related co-expression gene networks. Signatures of all brain regions and pathways that were prominent in the first method also surfaced in the second method, thus providing support that these brain regions and pathways are indeed involved in migraine pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most prevalent and highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. There is significant evidence that the onset and severity of ASD is governed in part by complex genetic mechanisms affecting the normal development of the brain. To date, a number of genes have been associated with ASD. However, the temporal and spatial co-expression of these genes in the brain remain unclear. To address this issue, we examined the co-expression network of 26 autism genes from AutDB (http://mindspec.org/autdb.html), in the framework of 3,041 genes whose expression energies have the highest correlation between the coronal and sagittal images from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas database (http://mouse.brain-map.org). These data were derived from in situ hybridization experiments conducted on male, 56-day old C57BL/6J mice co-registered to the Allen Reference Atlas, and were used to generate a normalized co-expression matrix indicating the cosine similarity between expression vectors of genes in this database. The network formed by the autism-associated genes showed a higher degree of co-expression connectivity than seen for the other genes in this dataset (Kolmogorov–Smirnov P = 5×10−28). Using Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two cliques of co-expressed genes that were significantly enriched with autism genes (A Bonferroni corrected P{\textless}0.05). Genes in both these cliques were significantly over-expressed in the cerebellar cortex (P = 1×10−5) suggesting possible implication of this brain region in autism. In conclusion, our study provides a detailed profiling of co-expression patterns of autism genes in the mouse brain, and suggests specific brain regions and new candidate genes that could be involved in autism etiology.},

Here, we propose a method termed ‘mixed random forest’ that simultaneously accounts for population structure and captures nonlinear genetic effects. We test the model in simulation experiments and show that the mixed random forest approach improves detection power compared with established approaches. In an application to data from an outbred mouse population, we find that mixed random forest identifies associations that are more consistent with prior knowledge than competing methods. Further, our approach allows predicting phenotypes from genotypes with greater accuracy than any of the other methods that we tested. Our results show that approaches that simultaneously account for both, confounding due to population structure and epistatic interactions, are important to fully explain the heritable component of complex quantitative traits.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-16-S2-S5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selection and identification are the most important tasks in Genome-wide association data analysis. The problem is difficult because genome-wide association data is very high dimensional and a large portion of SNPs in the data is irrelevant to the disease. Advanced machine learning methods have been successfully used in Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identification of genetic variants that have relatively big effects in some common, complex diseases. Among them, the most successful one is Random Forests (RF). Despite of performing well in terms of prediction accuracy in some data sets with moderate size, RF still suffers from working in GWAS for selecting informative SNPs and building accurate prediction models. In this paper, we propose to use a new two-stage quality-based sampling method in random forests, named ts-RF, for SNP subspace selection for GWAS. The method first applies p-value assessment to find a cut-off point that separates informative and irrelevant SNPs in two groups. The informative SNPs group is further divided into two sub-groups: highly informative and weak informative SNPs. When sampling the SNP subspace for building trees for the forest, only those SNPs from the two sub-groups are taken into account. The feature subspaces always contain highly informative SNPs when used to split a node at a tree.
RESULTS: This approach enables one to generate more accurate trees with a lower prediction error, meanwhile possibly avoiding overfitting. It allows one to detect interactions of multiple SNPs with the diseases, and to reduce the dimensionality and the amount of Genome-wide association data needed for learning the RF model. Extensive experiments on two genome-wide SNP data sets (Parkinson case-control data comprised of 408,803 SNPs and Alzheimer case-control data comprised of 380,157 SNPs) and 10 gene data sets have demonstrated that the proposed model significantly reduced prediction errors and outperformed most existing the-state-of-the-art random forests. The top 25 SNPs in Parkinson data set were identified by the proposed model including four interesting genes associated with neurological disorders.
CONCLUSION: The presented approach has shown to be effective in selecting informative sub-groups of SNPs potentially associated with diseases that traditional statistical approaches might fail. The new RF works well for the data where the number of case-control objects is much smaller than the number of SNPs, which is a typical problem in gene data and GWAS. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed RF model that outperformed the state-of-the-art RFs, including Breiman's RF, GRRF and wsRF methods.},

Currently, the inclusion/exclusion criteria mostly depend on ad-hoc expert opinion or naïve threshold by sample size or platform. There are pressing needs to develop a systematic QC methodology as the decision of study inclusion greatly impacts the final meta-analysis outcome. In this article, we propose six quantitative quality control measures, covering internal homogeneity of coexpression structure among studies, external consistency of coexpression pattern with pathway database, and accuracy and consistency of differentially expressed gene detection or enriched pathway identification. Each quality control index is defined as the minus log transformed P values from formal hypothesis testing. Principal component analysis biplots and a standardized mean rank are applied to assist visualization and decision. We applied the proposed method to 4 large-scale examples, combining 7 brain cancer, 9 prostate cancer, 8 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 17 major depressive disorder studies, respectively. The identified problematic studies were further scrutinized for potential technical or biological causes of their lower quality to determine their exclusion from meta-analysis.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Recent years has seen a boom in the application of the next-generation sequencing technology to the study of human diseases, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), where the focus has been on identifying rare, possibly causative genomic variants in ASD individuals. Because of the high genetic heterogeneity of ASD, a large number of subjects is needed to establish evidence for a variant or gene ASD-association, thus aggregating data across cohorts and studies is necessary. However, methodological inconsistencies and subject overlap across studies complicate data aggregation. Description: Here we present VariCarta, a web-based database developed to address these challenges by collecting, reconciling and consistently cataloguing literature-derived genomic variants found in ASD subjects using ongoing semi-manual curation. The careful manual curation combined with a robust data import pipeline rectifies errors, converts variants into a standardized format, identifies and harmonizes cohort overlaps and documents data provenance. The harmonization aspect is especially important since it prevents the potential double-counting of variants which can lead to inflation of gene-based evidence for ASD-association. Conclusion: VariCarta is the largest collection of systematically curated, harmonized and comprehensively annotated literature-derived ASD-associated variants. The database currently contains 35,615 variant events from 8,044 subjects, collected across 50 publications, and reconciles 6,057 variants that have been reported in literature multiple times.

The details of how genetic variation contributes to variable symptomatology are unclear, creating a major challenge for translating vast amounts of data into clinically-useful information. To determine if variation in ASD risk genes correlates with symptomatology differences among individuals with ASD, thus informing treatment, we developed an approach to calculate the likelihood of genetic dysfunction in Gene Ontology-defined biological processes that have significant overrepresentation of known risk genes. Using whole-exome sequence data from 2,381 individuals with ASD included in the Simons Simplex Collection, we identified likely damaging variants and conducted a clustering analysis to define subgroups based on scores reflecting genetic dysfunction in each process of interest to ASD etiology. Dysfunction in cognition-related genes distinguished a distinct subset of individuals with increased social deficits, lower IQs, and reduced adaptive behaviors when compared to individuals with no evidence of cognition-related gene dysfunction. In particular, a stop-gain variant in the pharmacogene encoding cycloxygenase-2 was associated with having an IQ\&lt;70 (i.e. intellectual disability), a key comorbidity in ASD. We expect that screening genes involved in cognition for deleterious variants in ASD cases may be useful for identifying clinically-informative factors that should be prioritized for functional follow-up. This has implications in designing more comprehensive genetic testing panels and may help provide the basis for more informed treatment in ASD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

There is now a large body of evidence that suggests a complex role of genetics in ASD, in which many different loci are involved. Although many current population scale genomic studies have been demonstrably fruitful, these studies generally focus on analyzing a limited part of the genome or use a limited set of bioinformatics tools. These limitations preclude the analysis of genome-wide perturbations that may contribute to the development and severity of ASD-related phenotypes. To overcome these limitations, we have developed and utilized an integrative clinical and bioinformatics pipeline for generating a more complete and reliable set of genomic variants for downstream analyses. Our study focuses on the analysis of three simplex autism families consisting of one affected child, unaffected parents, and one unaffected sibling. All members were clinically evaluated and widely phenotyped. Genotyping arrays and whole genome sequencing were performed on each member, and the resulting sequencing data were analyzed using a variety of available bioinformatics tools. We searched for rare variants of putative functional impact that were found to be segregating according to de-novo, autosomal recessive, x-linked, mitochondrial and compound heterozygote transmission models. The resulting candidate variants included three small heterozygous CNVs, a rare heterozygous \textit{de novo} nonsense mutation in \textit{MYBBP1A} located within exon 1, and a novel \textit{de novo} missense variant in \textit{LAMB3}. Our work demonstrates how more comprehensive analyses that include rich clinical data and whole genome sequencing data can generate reliable results for use in downstream investigations. We are moving to implement our framework for the analysis and study of larger cohorts of families, where statistical rigor can accompany genetic findings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Autism is a diagnostic label based on behavior. While the diagnostic criteria attempts to maximize clinical consensus, it also masks a wide degree of heterogeneity between and within individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Understanding this multi-level heterogeneity is of high clinical and translational importance. Here we present organizing principles to frame the work examining multi-level heterogeneity in autism. Theoretical concepts such as 9spectrum9 or 9autisms9 reflect non-mutually exclusive explanations regarding continuous/dimensional or categorical/qualitative variation between and within individuals. However, common practices of small sample size studies and case-control models are suboptimal for tackling heterogeneity. Big data is an important ingredient for furthering our understanding heterogeneity in autism. In addition to being 9feature-rich9, big data should be both 9broad9 (i.e. large sample size) and 9deep9 (i.e. multiple levels of data collected on the same individuals). These characteristics help ensure the results from a population are more generalizable and facilitate evaluation of the utility of different models of heterogeneity. A model9s utility can be shown by its ability to explain clinically or mechanistically important phenomena, but also by explaining how variability manifests across different levels of analysis. The directionality for explaining variability across levels can be bottom-up or top-down, and should include the importance of development for characterizing change within individuals. While progress can be made with 9supervised9 models built upon a priori or theoretically predicted distinctions or dimensions of importance, it will become increasingly important to complement such work with unsupervised data-driven discoveries that leverage unknown and multivariate distinctions within big data. Without a better understanding of how to model heterogeneity between autistic people, progress towards the goal of precision medicine may be limited.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background Phenotypic features associated with genes and diseases play an important role in disease-related studies and most of the available methods focus solely on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database without considering the controlled vocabulary. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized and controlled vocabulary covering phenotypic abnormalities in human diseases, and becomes a comprehensive resource for computational analysis of human disease phenotypes. Most of the existing HPO-based software tools cannot be used offline and provide only few similarity measures. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing a comprehensive and offline software for phenotypic features similarity based on HPO. Results HPOSim is an R package for analyzing phenotypic similarity for genes and diseases based on HPO data. Seven commonly used semantic similarity measures are implemented in HPOSim. Enrichment analysis of gene sets and disease sets are also implemented, including hypergeometric enrichment analysis and network ontology analysis (NOA).

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/108977},
	abstract = {One of the most important use cases of ontologies is the calculation of similarity scores between a query and items annotated with classes of an ontology. The hierarchical structure of an ontology does not necessarily reﬂect all relevant aspects of the domain it is modelling, and this can reduce the performance of ontology-based search algorithms. For instance, the classes of phenotype ontologies may be arranged according to anatomical criteria, but individual phenotypic features may aﬀect anatomic entities in opposite ways. Thus, “opposite” classes may be located in close proximity in an ontology; for example enlarged liver and small liver are grouped under abnormal liver size. Using standard similarity measures, these would be scored as being similar, despite in fact being opposites. In this paper, we use information about opposite ontology classes to extend two large phenotype ontologies, the human and the mammalian phenotype ontology. We also show that this information can be used to improve rankings based on similarity measures that incorporate this information. In particular, cosine similarity based measures show large improvements. We hypothesize this is due to the natural embedding of opposite phenotypes in vector space. We support the idea that the expressivity of semantic web technologies should be explored more extensively in biomedical ontologies and that similarity measures should be extended to incorporate more than the pure graph structure deﬁned by the subclass or part-of relationships of the underlying ontologies.},

	abstract = {De novo mutations affect risk for many diseases and disorders, especially those with early-onset. An example is autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Four recent whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies of ASD families revealed a handful of novel risk genes, based on independent de novo loss-of-function (LoF) mutations falling in the same gene, and found that de novo LoF mutations occurred at a twofold higher rate than expected by chance. However successful these studies were, they used only a small fraction of the data, excluding other types of de novo mutations and inherited rare variants. Moreover, such analyses cannot readily incorporate data from case-control studies. An important research challenge in gene discovery, therefore, is to develop statistical methods that accommodate a broader class of rare variation. We develop methods that can incorporate WES data regarding de novo mutations, inherited variants present, and variants identified within cases and controls. TADA, for Transmission And De novo Association, integrates these data by a gene-based likelihood model involving parameters for allele frequencies and gene-specific penetrances. Inference is based on a Hierarchical Bayes strategy that borrows information across all genes to infer parameters that would be difficult to estimate for individual genes. In addition to theoretical development we validated TADA using realistic simulations mimicking rare, large-effect mutations affecting risk for ASD and show it has dramatically better power than other common methods of analysis. Thus TADA's integration of various kinds of WES data can be a highly effective means of identifying novel risk genes. Indeed, application of TADA to WES data from subjects with ASD and their families, as well as from a study of ASD subjects and controls, revealed several novel and promising ASD candidate genes with strong statistical support.},

	abstract = {Advances in supervised learning have enabled accurate prediction in biological systems governed by complex interactions among biomolecules. However, state-of-the-art predictive algorithms are typically black-boxes, learning statistical interactions that are difficult to translate into testable hypotheses. The iterative Random Forest algorithm took a step towards bridging this gap by providing a computationally tractable procedure to identify the stable, high-order feature interactions that drive the predictive accuracy of Random Forests (RF). Here we refine the interactions identified by iRF to explicitly map responses as a function of interacting features. Our method, signed iRF, describes subsets of rules that frequently occur on RF decision paths. We refer to these rule subsets as signed interactions. Signed interactions share not only the same set of interacting features but also exhibit similar thresholding behavior, and thus describe a consistent functional relationship between interacting features and responses. We describe stable and predictive importance metrics to rank signed interactions. For each SPIM, we define null importance metrics that characterize its expected behavior under known structure. We evaluate our proposed approach in biologically inspired simulations and two case studies: predicting enhancer activity and spatial gene expression patterns. In the case of enhancer activity, s-iRF recovers one of the few experimentally validated high-order interactions and suggests novel enhancer elements where this interaction may be active. In the case of spatial gene expression patterns, s-iRF recovers all 11 reported links in the gap gene network. By refining the process of interaction recovery, our approach has the potential to guide mechanistic inquiry into systems whose scale and complexity is beyond human comprehension.},

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) allows composite phenotypes to be represented systematically but association methods accounting for the ontological relationship between HPO terms do not exist. We present a Bayesian method to model the association between an HPO-coded patient phenotype and genotype. Our method estimates the probability of an association together with an HPO-coded phenotype characteristic of the disease. We thus formalize a clinical approach to phenotyping that is lacking in standard regression techniques for rare disease research. We demonstrate the power of our method by uncovering a number of true associations in a large collection of genome-sequenced and HPO-coded cases with rare diseases.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1\% of world population and has become a pressing medical and social problem worldwide. As a paradigmatic complex genetic disease, ASD has been intensively studied and thousands of gene mutations have been reported. Because these mutations rarely recur, it is difficult to (i) pinpoint the fewer disease-causing versus majority random events and (ii) replicate or verify independent studies. A coherent and systematic understanding of autism biology has not been achieved. We analyzed 3392 and 4792 autism-related mutations from two large-scale whole-exome studies across multiple resolution levels, that is, variants (single-nucleotide), genes (protein-coding unit), and pathways (molecular module). These mutations do not recur or replicate at the variant level, but significantly and increasingly do so at gene and pathway levels. Genetic association reveals a novel gene + pathway dual-hit model, where the mutation burden becomes less relevant. In multiple independent analyses, hundreds of variants or genes repeatedly converge to several canonical pathways, either novel or literature-supported. These pathways define recurrent and systematic ASD biology, distinct from previously reported gene groups or networks. They also present a catalog of novel ASD risk factors including 118 variants and 72 genes. At a subpathway level, most variants disrupt the pathway-related gene functions, and in the same gene, they tend to hit residues extremely close to each other and in the same domain. Multiple interacting variants spotlight key modules, including the cAMP (adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate) second-messenger system and mGluR (metabotropic glutamate receptor) signaling regulation by GRKs (G protein–coupled receptor kinases). At a superpathway level, distinct pathways further interconnect and converge to three biology themes: synaptic function, morphology, and plasticity.

Phenotypic heterogeneity in autism has long been conjectured to be a
major hindrance to the discovery of genetic risk factors, leading to
numerous attempts to stratify children based on phenotype to increase power
of discovery studies. This approach, however, is based on the hypothesis
that phenotypic heterogeneity closely maps to genetic variation, which has
not been tested. Our study examines the impact of sub-phenotyping of a
well-characterized ASD sample on genetic homogeneity and the ability to
discover common genetic variants conferring liability to ASD.

Methods
Genome-wide genotypic data of 2576 families from the Simons Simplex
Collection (SSC) were analyzed in the overall sample and phenotypic
subgroups defined on the basis of diagnosis, IQ, and symptom profiles. We
conducted a family-based association study as well as estimating
heritability and evaluating allele scores for each phenotypic subgroup.

Results
Association analyses revealed no genome-wide significant association
signal. Sub-phenotyping did not increase power substantially. Moreover,
allele scores built from the most associated SNPs, based on the odds ratio
in the full sample, predicted case status in subsets of the sample equally
well and heritability estimates were very similar for all subgroups.

Conclusions
In genome-wide association analysis of the SSC sample, reducing
phenotypic heterogeneity had at most a modest impact on genetic homogeneity.
Our results are based on a relatively small sample, one with greater
homogeneity than the entire population; if they apply more broadly, they
imply that analysis of sub-phenotypes is not a productive path forward for
discovering genetic risk variants in ASD.},

We found that the prognostic performance varied substantially across cancer types. mRNA and miRNA expression profile frequently performed the best, followed by DNA methylation profile. Germline susceptibility variants displayed low prognostic performance consistently across cancer types. The integration of omic profiles with clinical variables can lead to substantially improved prognostic performance over the use of clinical variables alone in half of cancer types examined.

	abstract = {Background
The recent pandemic of obesity and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) has led to the realisation that new drug targets are needed to either reduce obesity or the subsequent pathophysiological consequences associated with excess weight gain. Certain nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) play a pivotal role in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and have been highlighted as potential treatments for obesity. This realisation started a search for NR agonists in order to understand and successfully treat MetS and associated conditions such as insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity and cardiovascular disease. The most studied NRs for treating metabolic diseases are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, and PPAR-δ. However, prolonged PPAR treatment in animal models has led to adverse side effects including increased risk of a number of cancers, but how these receptors change metabolism long term in terms of pathology, despite many beneficial effects shorter term, is not fully understood. In the current study, changes in male Sprague Dawley rat liver caused by dietary treatment with a PPAR-pan (PPAR-α, −γ, and –δ) agonist were profiled by classical toxicology (clinical chemistry) and high throughput metabolomics and lipidomics approaches using mass spectrometry.

Results
In order to integrate an extensive set of nine different multivariate metabolic and lipidomics datasets with classical toxicological parameters we developed a hypotheses free, data driven machine learning approach. From the data analysis, we examined how the nine datasets were able to model dose and clinical chemistry results, with the different datasets having very different information content.

Conclusions
We found lipidomics (Direct Infusion-Mass Spectrometry) data the most predictive for different dose responses. In addition, associations with the metabolic and lipidomic data with aspartate amino transaminase (AST), a hepatic leakage enzyme to assess organ damage, and albumin, indicative of altered liver synthetic function, were established. Furthermore, by establishing correlations and network connections between eicosanoids, phospholipids and triacylglycerols, we provide evidence that these lipids function as a key link between inflammatory processes and intermediary metabolism.

The accumulating wealth of multidimensional data provides a new paradigm for important research problems including cancer subtype discovery. The current standard approach relies on separate clustering analyses followed by manual integration. Results can be highly data type dependent, restricting the ability to discover new insights from multidimensional data. In this study, we present an integrative subtype analysis of the TCGA glioblastoma (GBM) data set. Our analysis revealed new insights through integrated subtype characterization. We found three distinct integrated tumor subtypes. Subtype 1 lacks the classical GBM events of chr 7 gain and chr 10 loss. This subclass is enriched for the G-CIMP phenotype and shows hypermethylation of genes involved in brain development and neuronal differentiation. The tumors in this subclass display a Proneural expression profile. Subtype 2 is characterized by a near complete association with EGFR amplification, overrepresentation of promoter methylation of homeobox and G-protein signaling genes, and a Classical expression profile. Subtype 3 is characterized by NF1 and PTEN alterations and exhibits a Mesenchymal-like expression profile. The data analysis workflow we propose provides a unified and computationally scalable framework to harness the full potential of large-scale integrated cancer genomic data for integrative subtype discovery.},

The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress.

Accordingly, a rational strategy minimizing survival of the drug-resistant subpopulation is essential to achieve long-term therapeutic efficacy.
RESULTS: Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we examine the intratumoral heterogeneity of a pair of primary renal cell carcinoma and its lung metastasis. Activation of drug target pathways demonstrates considerable variability between the primary and metastatic sites, as well as among individual cancer cells within each site. Based on the prediction of multiple drug target pathway activation, we derive a combinatorial regimen co-targeting two mutually exclusive pathways for the metastatic cancer cells. This combinatorial strategy shows significant increase in the treatment efficacy over monotherapy in the experimental validation using patient-derived xenograft platforms in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the investigational application of single-cell RNA-seq in the design of an anticancer regimen. The approach may overcome intratumoral heterogeneity which hampers the success of precision medicine.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Genetic heterogeneity is a hallmark of ovarian cancer biology and underlies treatment resistance. Defining the different cell types present within a single ovarian cancer is difficult, but could ultimately lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment. Next-generation sequencing technologies have rapidly increased our understanding of the molecular landscape of epithelial ovarian cancers, but the majority of these studies are conducted on bulk samples, resulting in data that represents an 'average' of all cells present. Single-cell sequencing provides a means to characterize heterogeneity with a tumor tissue in ovarian cancer patients and opens up opportunity to determine key molecular properties that influence clinical outcomes, including prognosis and treatment response.
SUMMARY: Single-cell sequencing provides a powerful tool in improving our understanding of tumor cell heterogeneity for the purpose of informing personalized cancer treatment.},

However, only a fraction of the hundreds of nominated ASD-related genes have identified de novo or transmitted loss of function (LOF) mutations that can be directly attributed to the disorder. For this reason, a means of prioritizing candidate genes for ASD would help filter out false-positive results and allow researchers to focus on genes that are more likely to be causative. Here we constructed a machine learning model by leveraging a brain-specific functional relationship network (FRN) of genes to produce a genome-wide ranking of ASD risk genes. We rigorously validated our gene ranking using results from two independent sequencing experiments, together representing over 5000 simplex and multiplex ASD families. Finally, through functional enrichment analysis on our highly prioritized candidate gene network, we identified a small number of pathways that are key in early neural development, providing further support for their potential role in ASD.},

	abstract = {Biological networks catalog the complex web of interactions happening between different molecules, typically proteins, within a cell. These networks are known to be highly modular, with groups of proteins associated with specific biological functions. Human diseases often arise from the dysfunction of one or more such proteins of the biological functional group. The ability, to identify and automatically extract these modules has implications for understanding the etiology of different diseases as well as the functional roles of different protein modules in disease. The recent DREAM challenge posed the problem of identifying disease modules from six heterogeneous networks of proteins/genes. There exist many community detection algorithms, but all of them are not adaptable to the biological context, as these networks are densely connected and the size of biologically relevant modules is quite small. The contribution of this study is 3-fold: first, we present a comprehensive assessment of many classic community detection algorithms for biological networks to identify non-overlapping communities, and propose heuristics to identify small and structurally well-defined communities-core modules. We evaluated our performance over 180 GWAS datasets. In comparison to traditional approaches, with our proposed approach we could identify 50\% more number of disease-relevant modules. Thus, we show that it is important to identify more compact modules for better performance. Next, we sought to understand the peculiar characteristics of disease-enriched modules and what causes standard community detection algorithms to detect so few of them. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the interaction patterns of known disease genes to understand the structure of disease modules and show that merely considering the known disease genes set as a module does not give good quality clusters, as measured by typical metrics such as modularity and conductance. We go on to present a methodology leveraging these known disease genes, to also include the neighboring nodes of these genes into a module, to form good quality clusters and subsequently extract a "gold-standard set" of disease modules. Lastly, we demonstrate, with justification, that "overlapping" community detection algorithms should be the preferred choice for disease module identification since several genes participate in multiple biological functions.},

Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome. In contrast, we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins, and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral, a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.},

Gene coexpression networks-created by integrating multiple expression datasets-connect genes with similar patterns of expression across multiple conditions. Dense gene communities in such networks, commonly referred to as modules, often indicate that the member genes are functionally related. As such, these modules serve as tools for generating new testable hypotheses, including the prediction of gene function and importance. Recently, we have seen a paradigm shift from the traditional "global" to more defined, context-specific coexpression networks. Such coexpression networks imply genetic correlations in specific biological contexts such as during development or in response to a stress.

Here we evaluate the system-level properties of cosplicing in mouse, macaque, and human brain gene expression data using a novel network inference procedure. Genes are represented as vectors/lists of exon counts and distance measures sensitive to exon inclusion rates quantifies differences across samples. For all gene pairs, distance matrices are correlated across samples, resulting in cosplicing or cotranscriptional network matrices. We show that networks including cosplicing information are scale-free and distinct from coexpression. In the networks capturing cosplicing we find a set of novel hubs with unique characteristics distinguishing them from coexpression hubs: heavy representation in neurobiological functional pathways, strong overlap with markers of neurons and neuroglia, long coding lengths, and high number of both exons and annotated transcripts. Further, the cosplicing hubs are enriched in genes associated with autism spectrum disorders. Cosplicing hub homologs across eukaryotes show dramatically increasing intronic lengths but stable coding region lengths. Shared transcription factor binding sites increase coexpression but not cosplicing; the reverse is true for splicing-factor binding sites. Genes with protein-protein interactions have strong coexpression and cosplicing. Additional factors affecting the networks include shared microRNA binding sites, spatial colocalization within the striatum, and sharing a chromosomal folding domain. Cosplicing network patterns remain relatively stable across species.},

Gene-gene expression correlations are a common source of molecular networks because they can be extracted from high-dimensional disease data and encapsulate the activity of multiple regulatory systems. However, the analysis of gene coexpression patterns is often treated as a mechanistic black box, in which looming 'hub genes' direct cellular networks, and where other features are obscured. By examining the biophysical bases of coexpression and gene regulatory changes that occur in disease, recent studies suggest it is possible to use coexpression networks as a multi-omic screening procedure to generate novel hypotheses for disease mechanisms. Because technical processing steps can affect the outcome and interpretation of coexpression networks, we examine the assumptions and alternatives to common patterns of coexpression analysis and discuss additional topics such as acceptable datasets for coexpression analysis, the robust identification of modules, disease-related prioritization of genes and molecular systems and network meta-analysis. To accelerate coexpression research beyond modules and hubs, we highlight some emerging directions for coexpression network research that are especially relevant to complex brain disease, including the centrality-lethality relationship, integration with machine learning approaches and network pharmacology.},

	abstract = {The application of complex network modeling to analyze large co-expression data sets has gained traction during the last decade. In particular, the use of the weighted gene co-expression network analysis framework has allowed an unbiased and systems-level investigation of genotype-phenotype relationships in a wide range of systems. Since mouse is an important model organism for biomedical research on human disease, it is of great interest to identify similarities and differences in the functional roles of human and mouse orthologous genes. Here, we develop a novel network comparison approach which we demonstrate by comparing two gene-expression data sets from a large number of human and mouse tissues. The method uses weighted topological overlap alongside the recently developed network-decomposition method of s-core analysis, which is suitable for making gene-centrality rankings for weighted networks. The aim is to identify globally central genes separately in the human and mouse networks. By comparing the ranked gene lists, we identify genes that display conserved or diverged centrality-characteristics across the networks. This framework only assumes a single threshold value that is chosen from a statistical analysis, and it may be applied to arbitrary network structures and edge-weight distributions, also outside the context of biology. When conducting the comparative network analysis, both within and across the two species, we find a clear pattern of enrichment of transcription factors, for the homeobox domain in particular, among the globally central genes. We also perform gene-ontology term enrichment analysis and look at disease-related genes for the separate networks as well as the network comparisons. We find that gene ontology terms related to regulation and development are generally enriched across the networks. In particular, the genes FOXE3, RHO, RUNX2, ALX3 and RARA, which are disease genes in either human or mouse, are on the top-10 list of globally central genes in the human and mouse networks.},

In this article, known disease-gene associations were represented using a weighted bipartite network. We extracted a weighted human diseases network from such a bipartite network to show the correlations of diseases. Subsequently, we proposed a new centrality measurement for the weighted human disease network (WHDN) in order to quantify the importance of diseases. Using our centrality measurement to quantify the importance of vertices in WHDN, we were able to find a set of most central diseases. By investigating the 30 top diseases and their most correlated neighbors in the network, we identified disease linkages including known disease pairs and novel findings. Our research helps better understand the common genetic origin of human diseases and suggests top diseases that likely induce other related diseases.},

Ontologies provide a formal representation of knowledge that is amenable to computational as well as human analysis, an obvious underpinning of systems biology. Mapping function to gene products in the genome consists of two, somewhat intertwined enterprises: ontology building and ontology annotation. Ontology building is the formal representation of a domain of knowledge; ontology annotation is association of specific genomic regions (which we refer to simply as 'genes', including genes and their regulatory elements and products such as proteins and functional RNAs) to parts of the ontology. We consider two complementary representations of gene function: the Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway ontologies. GO represents function from the gene's eye view, in relation to a large and growing context of biological knowledge at all levels. Pathway ontologies represent function from the point of view of biochemical reactions and interactions, which are ordered into networks and causal cascades. The more mature GO provides an example of ontology annotation: how conclusions from the scientific literature and from evolutionary relationships are converted into formal statements about gene function. Annotations are made using a variety of different types of evidence, which can be used to estimate the relative reliability of different annotations.},

Here we present a semi-supervised method called Unicorn that extends these previous methods to tackle the three problems. Unicorn uses a sub-tree of an existing GO sub-ontology as training part to learn parameters in integrating multiple networks. Cross-validation results show that Unicorn reliably inferred the left-out parts of each specific GO sub-ontology. In addition, by training Unicorn with an old version of GO together with biological networks, it successfully re-discovered some terms and term-term relationships present only in a new version of GO. Unicorn also successfully inferred some novel terms that were not contained in GO but have biological meanings well-supported by the literature.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exome sequencing is a promising method for diagnosing patients with a complex phenotype. However, variant interpretation relative to patient phenotype can be challenging in some scenarios, particularly clinical assessment of rare complex phenotypes. Each patient's sequence reveals many possibly damaging variants that must be individually assessed to establish clear association with patient phenotype. To assist interpretation, we implemented an algorithm that ranks a given set of genes relative to patient phenotype. The algorithm orders genes by the semantic similarity computed between phenotypic descriptors associated with each gene and those describing the patient. Phenotypic descriptor terms are taken from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and semantic similarity is derived from each term's information content.
RESULTS: Model validation was performed via simulation and with clinical data. We simulated 33 Mendelian diseases with 100 patients per disease. We modeled clinical conditions by adding noise and imprecision, i.e. phenotypic terms unrelated to the disease and terms less specific than the actual disease terms. We ranked the causative gene against all 2488 HPO annotated genes. The median causative gene rank was 1 for the optimal and noise cases, 12 for the imprecision case, and 60 for the imprecision with noise case. Additionally, we examined a clinical cohort of subjects with hearing impairment. The disease gene median rank was 22. However, when also considering the patient's exome data and filtering non-exomic and common variants, the median rank improved to 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Semantic similarity can rank a causative gene highly within a gene list relative to patient phenotype characteristics, provided that imprecision is mitigated. The clinical case results suggest that phenotype rank combined with variant analysis provides significant improvement over the individual approaches. We expect that this combined prioritization approach may increase accuracy and decrease effort for clinical genetic diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation (CTTV - https://www.targetvalidation.org/) was established to generate therapeutic target evidence from genome-scale experiments and analyses. CTTV aims to support the validity of therapeutic targets by integrating existing and newly-generated data. Data integration has been achieved in some resources by mapping metadata such as disease and phenotypes to the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO). Additionally, the relationship between ontology descriptions of rare and common diseases and their phenotypes can offer insights into shared biological mechanisms and potential drug targets. Ontologies are not ideal for representing the sometimes associated type relationship required. This work addresses two challenges; annotation of diverse big data, and representation of complex, sometimes associated relationships between concepts.
METHODS: Semantic mapping uses a combination of custom scripting, our annotation tool 'Zooma', and expert curation. Disease-phenotype associations were generated using literature mining on Europe PubMed Central abstracts, which were manually verified by experts for validity. Representation of the disease-phenotype association was achieved by the Ontology of Biomedical AssociatioN (OBAN), a generic association representation model. OBAN represents associations between a subject and object i.e., disease and its associated phenotypes and the source of evidence for that association. The indirect disease-to-disease associations are exposed through shared phenotypes. This was applied to the use case of linking rare to common diseases at the CTTV.
RESULTS: EFO yields an average of over 80\% of mapping coverage in all data sources. A 42\% precision is obtained from the manual verification of the text-mined disease-phenotype associations. This results in 1452 and 2810 disease-phenotype pairs for IBD and autoimmune disease and contributes towards 11,338 rare diseases associations (merged with existing published work [Am J Hum Genet 97:111-24, 2015]). An OBAN result file is downloadable at http://sourceforge.net/p/efo/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/src/efoassociations/. Twenty common diseases are linked to 85 rare diseases by shared phenotypes. A generalizable OBAN model for association representation is presented in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we present solutions to large-scale annotation-ontology mapping in the CTTV knowledge base, a process for disease-phenotype mining, and propose a generic association model, 'OBAN', as a means to integrate disease using shared phenotypes.

Phenotypes associated with engineered and natural genetic variation are widely recorded using phenotype ontologies in model organisms, as are signs and symptoms of human Mendelian diseases in databases such as OMIM and Orphanet. Exploiting these resources, several computational methods have been developed for integration and analysis of phenotype data to identify the genetic etiology of diseases or suggest plausible interventions. A similar resource would be highly useful not only for rare and Mendelian diseases, but also for common, complex and infectious diseases. We apply a semantic text-mining approach to identify the phenotypes (signs and symptoms) associated with over 6,000 diseases. We evaluate our text-mined phenotypes by demonstrating that they can correctly identify known disease-associated genes in mice and humans with high accuracy. Using a phenotypic similarity measure, we generate a human disease network in which diseases that have similar signs and symptoms cluster together, and we use this network to identify closely related diseases based on common etiological, anatomical as well as physiological underpinnings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic epistasis is an often-overlooked area in the study of the genomics of complex traits. Genome-wide association studies are a useful tool for revealing potential causal genetic variants, but in this context, epistasis is generally ignored. Data complexity and interpretation issues make it difficult to process and interpret epistasis. As the number of interaction grows exponentially with the number of variants, computational limitation is a bottleneck. Gene Network based strategies have been successful in integrating biological data and identifying relevant hub genes and pathways related to complex traits. In this study, epistatic interactions and network-based analysis are combined in the Weighted Interaction SNP hub (WISH) method and implemented in an efficient and easy to use R package.
RESULTS: The WISH R package (WISH-R) was developed to calculate epistatic interactions on a genome-wide level based on genomic data. It is easy to use and install, and works on regular genomic data. The package filters data based on linkage disequilibrium and calculates epistatic interaction coefficients between SNP pairs based on a parallelized efficient linear model and generalized linear model implementations. Normalized epistatic coefficients are analyzed in a network framework, alleviating multiple testing issues and integrating biological signal to identify modules and pathways related to complex traits. Functions for visualizing results and testing runtimes are also provided.
CONCLUSION: The WISH-R package is an efficient implementation for analyzing genome-wide epistasis for complex diseases and traits. It includes methods and strategies for analyzing epistasis from initial data filtering until final data interpretation. WISH offers a new way to analyze genomic data by combining epistasis and network based analysis in one method and provides options for visualizations. This alleviates many of the existing hurdles in the analysis of genomic interactions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput genotype (HTG) data has been used primarily in genome-wide association (GWA) studies; however, GWA results explain only a limited part of the complete genetic variation of traits. In systems genetics, network approaches have been shown to be able to identify pathways and their underlying causal genes to unravel the biological and genetic background of complex diseases and traits, e.g., the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method based on microarray gene expression data. The main objective of this study was to develop a scale-free weighted genetic interaction network method using whole genome HTG data in order to detect biologically relevant pathways and potential genetic biomarkers for complex diseases and traits.
RESULTS: We developed the Weighted Interaction SNP Hub (WISH) network method that uses HTG data to detect genome-wide interactions between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and its relationship with complex traits. Data dimensionality reduction was achieved by selecting SNPs based on its: 1) degree of genome-wide significance and 2) degree of genetic variation in a population. Network construction was based on pairwise Pearson's correlation between SNP genotypes or the epistatic interaction effect between SNP pairs. To identify modules the Topological Overlap Measure (TOM) was calculated, reflecting the degree of overlap in shared neighbours between SNP pairs. Modules, clusters of highly interconnected SNPs, were defined using a tree-cutting algorithm on the SNP dendrogram created from the dissimilarity TOM (1-TOM). Modules were selected for functional annotation based on their association with the trait of interest, defined by the Genome-wide Module Association Test (GMAT). We successfully tested the established WISH network method using simulated and real SNP interaction data and GWA study results for carcass weight in a pig resource population; this resulted in detecting modules and key functional and biological pathways related to carcass weight.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed the WISH network method which is a novel 'systems genetics' approach to study genetic networks underlying complex trait variation. The WISH network method reduces data dimensionality and statistical complexity in associating genotypes with phenotypes in GWA studies and enables researchers to identify biologically relevant pathways and potential genetic biomarkers for any complex trait of interest.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genetic regulation of metabolic phenotypes (i.e., metabotypes) in type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs through complex organ-specific cellular mechanisms and networks contributing to impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Genome-wide gene expression profiling systems can dissect the genetic contributions to metabolome and transcriptome regulations. The integrative analysis of multiple gene expression traits and metabolic phenotypes (i.e., metabotypes) together with their underlying genetic regulation remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a systems genetics approach based on the topological analysis of a combined molecular network made of genes and metabolites identified through expression and metabotype quantitative trait locus mapping (i.e., eQTL and mQTL) to prioritise biological characterisation of candidate genes and traits.
METHODS: We used systematic metabotyping by 1H NMR spectroscopy and genome-wide gene expression in white adipose tissue to map molecular phenotypes to genomic blocks associated with obesity and insulin secretion in a series of rat congenic strains derived from spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and normoglycemic Brown-Norway (BN) rats. We implemented a network biology strategy approach to visualize the shortest paths between metabolites and genes significantly associated with each genomic block.
RESULTS: Despite strong genomic similarities (95-99 \%) among congenics, each strain exhibited specific patterns of gene expression and metabotypes, reflecting the metabolic consequences of series of linked genetic polymorphisms in the congenic intervals. We subsequently used the congenic panel to map quantitative trait loci underlying specific mQTLs and genome-wide eQTLs. Variation in key metabolites like glucose, succinate, lactate, or 3-hydroxybutyrate and second messenger precursors like inositol was associated with several independent genomic intervals, indicating functional redundancy in these regions. To navigate through the complexity of these association networks we mapped candidate genes and metabolites onto metabolic pathways and implemented a shortest path strategy to highlight potential mechanistic links between metabolites and transcripts at colocalized mQTLs and eQTLs. Minimizing the shortest path length drove prioritization of biological validations by gene silencing.
CONCLUSIONS: These results underline the importance of network-based integration of multilevel systems genetics datasets to improve understanding of the genetic architecture of metabotype and transcriptomic regulation and to characterize novel functional roles for genes determining tissue-specific metabolism.},

The falling cost of next-generation sequencing is now enabling researchers to routinely catalogue the molecular components of these networks at a genome-wide scale and over a large number of different conditions. In this review, we describe how to use publicly available bioinformatics tools to integrate genome-wide 'omics' data into a network of experimentally-supported molecular interactions. In addition, we describe how to visualize and analyze these networks to identify topological features of likely functional relevance, including network hubs, bottlenecks and modules. We show that network biology provides a powerful conceptual approach to integrate and find patterns in genome-wide genomic data but we also discuss the limitations and caveats of these methods, of which researchers adopting these methods must remain aware.},

However, relevant subtypes are often unknown, unmeasured, or actively debated, making automated statistical approaches to subtype definition valuable. We propose reverse GWAS (RGWAS) to identify and validate subtypes using genetics and multiple traits: while GWAS seeks the genetic basis of a given trait, RGWAS seeks to define trait subtypes with distinct genetic bases. Unlike existing approaches relying on off-the-shelf clustering methods, RGWAS uses a novel decomposition, MFMR, to model covariates, binary traits, and population structure. We use extensive simulations to show that modelling these features can be crucial for power and calibration. We validate RGWAS in practice by recovering a recently discovered stress subtype in major depression. We then show the utility of RGWAS by identifying three novel subtypes of metabolic traits. We biologically validate these metabolic subtypes with SNP-level tests and a novel polygenic test: the former recover known metabolic GxE SNPs; the latter suggests subtypes may explain substantial missing heritability. Crucially, statins, which are widely prescribed and theorized to increase diabetes risk, have opposing effects on blood glucose across metabolic subtypes, suggesting the subtypes have potential translational value.},

Our goal was to develop an ontology that can be used 1) to provide improved access to the data collected by those who study ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, and 2) to assess and compare the characteristics of the instruments that are used in the assessment of ASD. We analyzed two dozen instruments used to assess ASD, studying the nature of the questions asked and items assessed, the method of delivery, and the overall scope of the content. These data together with the extensive literature on ASD contributed to our iterative development of an ASD phenotype ontology. The final ontology comprises 283 concepts distributed across three high-level classes, 'Personal Traits', 'Social Competence', and 'Medical History'. The ontology is fully integrated with the Autism Consortium database, allowing researchers to pose ontology-based questions. The ontology also allows researchers to assess the degree of overlap among a set of candidate instruments according to several objective criteria. The ASD phenotype ontology has promise for use in research settings where extensive phenotypic data have been collected, allowing a concept-based approach to identifying behavioral features of importance and for correlating these with genotypic data.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the genetic basis of disease has evolved from descriptions of overall heritability or familiality to identifying large numbers of risk loci. One can quantify the impact of such loci on disease using a plethora of measures, which can guide decisions on new experiments, for example, whether to focus on the biology of identified variants or put more effort into discovering novel variants. However, different measures can attribute varying degrees of importance to a variant. We consider and contrast the most commonly used measures, specifically the heritability of disease liability, approximate heritability, sibling recurrence risk, overall genetic variance using a log relative risk scale, the area under the receiver-operating curve for risk prediction, and the population attributable fraction, and give guidelines for their use that should be explicitly considered when assessing the contribution of genetic variants to disease.},

	abstract = {Objectives We aimed to investigate the role of serum uric acid (SUA) level in a broad spectrum of disease outcomes using data for 120 091 individuals from UK Biobank.
Methods We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify disease outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci. We then implemented conventional Mendelianrandomisation (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relevance between SUA level and disease outcomes identified from PheWAS. We next applied MR Egger analysis to detect and account for potential pleiotropy, which conventional MR analysis might mistake for causality, and used the HEIDI (heterogeneity in dependent instruments) test to remove cross-phenotype associations that were likely due to genetic linkage.
Results Our PheWAS identified 25 disease groups/outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci after multiple testing correction (P{\textless}8.57e-05). Our conventional MR analysis implicated a causal role of SUA level in three disease groups: inflammatory polyarthropathies (OR=1.22, 95\% CI 1.11 to 1.34), hypertensive disease (OR=1.08, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.14) and disorders of metabolism (OR=1.07, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.14); and four disease outcomes: gout (OR=4.88, 95\% CI 3.91 to 6.09), essential hypertension (OR=1.08, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.14), myocardial infarction (OR=1.16, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.30) and coeliac disease (OR=1.41, 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.89). After balancing pleiotropic effects in MR Egger analysis, only gout and its encompassing disease group of inflammatory polyarthropathies were considered to be causally associated with SUA level. Our analysis highlighted a locus (ATXN2/S2HB3) that may influence SUA level and multiple cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases via pleiotropy.
Conclusions Elevated SUA level is convincing to cause gout and inflammatory polyarthropathies, and might act as a marker for the wider range of diseases with which it associates. Our findings support further investigation on the clinical relevance of SUA level with cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune and respiratory diseases.},

A cross-sectional study of brain substructures was conducted at the first time-point as part of an ongoing longitudinal MRI study of brain development in FXS. The study included 52 boys between 18–42 months of age with FXS and 118 comparison children (boys with autism-non FXS, developmental-delay, and typical development). Children with FXS and autistic disorder had substantially enlarged caudate volume and smaller amygdala volume; whereas those children with autistic disorder without FXS (i.e., idiopathic autism) had only modest enlargement in their caudate nucleus volumes but more robust enlargement of their amygdala volumes. Although we observed this double dissociation among selected brain volumes, no significant differences in severity of autistic behavior between these groups were observed. This study offers a unique examination of early brain development in two disorders, FXS and idiopathic autism, with overlapping behavioral features, but two distinct patterns of brain morphology. We observed that despite almost a third of our FXS sample meeting criteria for autism, the profile of brain volume differences for children with FXS and autism differed from those with idiopathic autism. These findings underscore the importance of addressing heterogeneity in studies of autistic behavior.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Multiple articles describe a constellation of language, personality, and social-behavioral features present in relatives that mirror the symptom domains of autism, but are much milder in expression. Studies of this broad autism phenotype (BAP) may provide a potentially important complementary approach for detecting the genes causing autism and defining associated neural circuitry by identifying more refined phenotypes that can be measured quantitatively in both affected and unaffected individuals and that are tied to functioning in particular regions of the brain.
OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into neuropsychological features that index genetic liability to autism.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: The general community.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight high-functioning individuals with autism and parents of autistic individuals, both with and without the BAP (n = 83), as well as control individuals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tasks assessing social cognition, executive function, and global vs local processing strategies (central coherence).
RESULTS: Both individuals with autism and parents with the BAP differed from controls on measures of social cognition, with performance in the other 2 domains being more similar to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that the social cognitive domain may be an important target for linking phenotype to cognitive process to brain structure in autism and may ultimately provide insight into the genes involved in autism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic rating scales represent an important resource for standardized data collection. However, the ability to exploit reasoning on rating scale data is still limited. The objective of this work is to facilitate the integration of the semantics required to automatically interpret collections of standardized clinical data. We developed an electronic prototype for the Scale of the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), broadly used in neurology. In order to address the modeling challenges of the SARA, we propose to combine the best performances from OpenEHR clinical archetypes, guidelines and ontologies.
METHODS: A scaled-down version of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) was built, extracting the terms that describe the SARA tests from free-text sources. This version of the HPO was then used as backbone to normalize the content of the SARA through clinical archetypes. The knowledge required to exploit reasoning on the SARA data was modeled as separate information-processing units interconnected via the defined archetypes. Each unit used the most appropriate technology to formally represent the required knowledge.
RESULTS: Based on this approach, we implemented a prototype named SARA Management System, to be used for both the assessment of cerebellar syndrome and the production of a clinical synopsis. For validation purposes, we used recorded SARA data from 28 anonymous subjects affected by Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 36 (SCA36). When comparing the performance of our prototype with that of two independent experts, weighted kappa scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.86.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of archetypes, phenotype ontologies and electronic information-processing rules can be used to automate the extraction of relevant clinical knowledge from plain scores of rating scales. Our results reveal a substantial degree of agreement between the results achieved by an ontology-aware system and the human experts.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to create an ontology that will allow data integration and reasoning with subject data to classify subjects, and based on this classification, to infer new knowledge on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). We take a first step toward this goal by extending an existing autism ontology to allow automatic inference of ASD phenotypes and Diagnostic \& Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria based on subjects' Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessment data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Knowledge regarding diagnostic instruments, ASD phenotypes and risk factors was added to augment an existing autism ontology via Ontology Web Language class definitions and semantic web rules. We developed a custom Protégé plugin for enumerating combinatorial OWL axioms to support the many-to-many relations of ADI-R items to diagnostic categories in the DSM. We utilized a reasoner to infer whether 2642 subjects, whose data was obtained from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, meet DSM-IV-TR (DSM-IV) and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria based on their ADI-R data.
RESULTS: We extended the ontology by adding 443 classes and 632 rules that represent phenotypes, along with their synonyms, environmental risk factors, and frequency of comorbidities. Applying the rules on the data set showed that the method produced accurate results: the true positive and true negative rates for inferring autistic disorder diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria were 1 and 0.065, respectively; the true positive rate for inferring ASD based on DSM-5 criteria was 0.94.
DISCUSSION: The ontology allows automatic inference of subjects' disease phenotypes and diagnosis with high accuracy.
CONCLUSION: The ontology may benefit future studies by serving as a knowledge base for ASD. In addition, by adding knowledge of related NDDs, commonalities and differences in manifestations and risk factors could be automatically inferred, contributing to the understanding of ASD pathophysiology.},

Recent studies have attempted to reduce the “noise” in genetic and other biological data by reducing the phenotypic heterogeneity of the sample population. The current study employs multiple clustering algorithms on 123 item scores from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) diagnostic instrument of nearly 2000 autistic individuals to identify subgroups of autistic probands with clinically relevant behavioral phenotypes in order to isolate more homogeneous groups of subjects for gene expression analyses. Our combined cluster analyses suggest optimal division of the autistic probands into 4 phenotypic clusters based on similarity of symptom severity across the 123 selected item scores. One cluster is characterized by severe language deficits, while another exhibits milder symptoms across the domains. A third group possesses a higher frequency of savant skills while the fourth group exhibited intermediate severity across all domains. Grouping autistic individuals by multivariate cluster analysis of ADI-R scores reveals meaningful phenotypes of subgroups within the autistic spectrum which we show, in a related (accompanying) study, to be associated with distinct gene expression profiles.},

	abstract = {Porphyromonas gingivalis, the keystone pathogen in chronic periodontitis, was identified in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients. Toxic proteases from the bacterium called gingipains were also identified in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, and levels correlated with tau and ubiquitin pathology. Oral P. gingivalis infection in mice resulted in brain colonization and increased production of Aβ1–42, a component of amyloid plaques. Further, gingipains were neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro, exerting detrimental effects on tau, a protein needed for normal neuronal function. To block this neurotoxicity, we designed and synthesized small-molecule inhibitors targeting gingipains. Gingipain inhibition reduced the bacterial load of an established P. gingivalis brain infection, blocked Aβ1–42 production, reduced neuroinflammation, and rescued neurons in the hippocampus. These data suggest that gingipain inhibitors could be valuable for treating P. gingivalis brain colonization and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.
Gingipains from Porphyromonas gingivalis drive Alzheimer’s pathology and can be blocked with small-molecule inhibitors.

METHODS: Three groups, comprising 38 mothers of children previously diagnosed with autism (DSM IV-TR, 2002), 43 mothers of children with language disorders other than autism, and 52 mothers of children who had no linguistic or behavioral complaints, were interviewed. In order to minimize the effect of maternal level of education, the questionnaire was completed by the researcher. To determine the concurrent validation, ANOVA and discriminant analysis were used. The ROC curve was used to establish the cutoff score of the sample and to examine the criterion validity.
RESULTS: The mean total score was significantly higher in the group of mothers of autistic children than in the other groups. The ABC correctly identified 81.6\% of the autistic children. The ROC curve cutoff score was 49, and the sensitivity was 92.1\%, higher than the 57.89\% found when a cutoff score of 68 was used. The specificity was 92.6\%, similar to the 94.73\% obtained with a cutoff score of 68.

	abstract = {Sequencing of the human genome has opened the door to the most exciting new era for the holistic system description of human health. It is now possible to study the underlying mechanisms of human health in relation to diet and other environmental factors such as drugs and toxic pollutants. Technological advances make it feasible to envisage that in the future personalized drug treatment and dietary advice and possibly tailored food products can be used for promoting optimal health on an individual basis, in relation to genotype and lifestyle. Life-Science research has in the past very much focused on diseases and how to reestablish human health after illness. Today, the role of food and nutrition in human health and especially prevention of illness is gaining recognition. Diseases of modern civilization, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer have been shown to be effected by dietary patterns. The risk of disease is often associated with genetic polymorphisms, but the effect is dependent on dietary intake and nutritional status. To understand the link between diet and health, nutritional-research must cover a broad range of areas, from the molecular level to whole body studies. Therefore it provides an excellent example of integrative biology requiring a systems biology approach. The current state and implications of systems biology in the understanding of human health are reviewed. It becomes clear that a complete mechanistic description of the human organism is not yet possible. However, recent advances in systems biology provide a trajectory for future research in order to improve health of individuals and populations. Disease prevention through personalized nutrition will become more important as the obvious avenue of research in life sciences and more focus will need to be put upon those natural ways of disease prevention. In particular, the new discipline of nutrigenomics, which investigates how nutrients interact with humans, taking predetermined genetic factors into account, will mediate new insights into human health that will finally have significant positive impact on our quality of life.},

Current challenges include understanding disease as a result of the interplay between environmental and genetic perturbations and assessing the impact of personal sequence variations in the context of networks.

Consequently, the discipline of physiology has since its infancy attempted to link multiple levels of biological organization. Increasingly this has involved mathematical and computational approaches, typically to model a small number of components spanning several levels of biological organization. With the advent of "omics" technologies, which can characterize the molecular state of a cell or tissue (intended as the level of expression and/or activity of its molecular components), the number of molecular components we can quantify has increased exponentially. Paradoxically, the unprecedented amount of experimental data has made it more difficult to derive conceptual models underlying essential mechanisms regulating mammalian physiology. We present an overview of state-of-the-art methods currently used to identifying biological networks underlying genomewide responses. These are based on a data-driven approach that relies on advanced computational methods designed to "learn" biology from observational data. In this review, we illustrate an application of these computational methodologies using a case study integrating an in vivo model representing the transcriptional state of hypoxic skeletal muscle with a clinical study representing muscle wasting in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. The broader application of these approaches to modeling multiple levels of biological data in the context of modern physiology is discussed.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Analysing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for copy number variations (CNVs) detection is a relatively new and challenging field, with no accepted standard protocols or quality control measures so far. There are by now several algorithms developed for each of the four broad methods for CNV detection using NGS, namely the depth of coverage (DOC), read-pair, split-read and assembly-based methods. However, because of the complexity of the genome and the short read lengths from NGS technology, there are still many challenges associated with the analysis of NGS data for CNVs, no matter which method or algorithm is used.
RESULTS: In this review, we describe and discuss areas of potential biases in CNV detection for each of the four methods. In particular, we focus on issues pertaining to (i) mappability, (ii) GC-content bias, (iii) quality control measures of reads and (iv) difficulty in identifying duplications. To gain insights to some of the issues discussed, we also download real data from the 1000 Genomes Project and analyse its DOC data. We show examples of how reads in repeated regions can affect CNV detection, demonstrate current GC-correction algorithms, investigate sensitivity of DOC algorithm before and after quality control of reads and discuss reasons for which duplications are harder to detect than deletions.},

	abstract = {Structural variation (also genomic structural variation) is the variation in structure of an organism's chromosome. It consists of many kinds of variation in the genome of one species, and usually includes microscopic and submicroscopic types, such as deletions, duplications, copy-number variants, insertions, inversions and translocations. Originally, a structure variation affects a sequence length about 1Kb to 3Mb, which is larger than SNPs and smaller than chromosome abnormality (though the definitions have some overlap). However, the operational range of structural variants has widened to include events {\textgreater}50bp. The definition of structural variation does not imply anything about frequency or phenotypical effects. Many structural variants are associated with genetic diseases, however many are not. Recent research about SVs indicates that SVs are more difficult to detect than SNPs. Approximately 13\% of the human genome are defined as structurally variant in the normal population, and there are at least 240 genes that exist as homozygous deletion polymorphisms in human populations, suggesting these genes are dispensable in humans. Rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that structural variations can comprise millions of nucleotides of heterogeneity within every genome, and are likely to make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility.},

High-throughput sequencing technology has revolutionized both medical and biological research by generating exceedingly large numbers of genetic variants. The resulting datasets share a number of common characteristics that might lead to poor generalization capacity. Concerns include noise accumulated due to the large number of predictors, sparse information regarding the p≫n problem, and overfitting and model mis-identification resulting from spurious collinearity. Additionally, complex correlation patterns are present among variables. As a consequence, reliable variable selection techniques play a pivotal role in predictive analysis, generalization capability, and robustness in clustering, as well as interpretability of the derived models.

Methods and findings
K-dominating set, a parameterized graph-theoretic generalization model, was used to model SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data as a similarity network and searched for representative SNP variables. In particular, each SNP was represented as a vertex in the graph, (dis)similarity measures such as correlation coefficients or pairwise linkage disequilibrium were estimated to describe the relationship between each pair of SNPs; a pair of vertices are adjacent, i.e. joined by an edge, if the pairwise similarity measure exceeds a user-specified threshold. A minimum k-dominating set in the SNP graph was then made as the smallest subset such that every SNP that is excluded from the subset has at least k neighbors in the selected ones. The strength of k-dominating set selection in identifying independent variables, and in culling representative variables that are highly correlated with others, was demonstrated by a simulated dataset. The advantages of k-dominating set variable selection were also illustrated in two applications: pedigree reconstruction using SNP profiles of 1,372 Douglas-fir trees, and species delineation for 226 grasshopper mouse samples.

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular deep learning architecture widely applied in different domains, in particular in classifying over images, for which the concept of convolution with a filter comes naturally. Unfortunately, the requirement of a distance (or, at least, of a neighbourhood function) in the input feature space has so far prevented its direct use on data types such as omics data. However, a number of omics data are metrizable, i.e., they can be endowed with a metric structure, enabling to adopt a convolutional based deep learning framework, e.g., for prediction. We propose a generalized solution for CNNs on omics data, implemented through a dedicated Keras layer. In particular, for metagenomics data, a metric can be derived from the patristic distance on the phylogenetic tree. For transcriptomics data, we combine Gene Ontology semantic similarity and gene co-expression to define a distance; the function is defined through a multilayer network where 3 layers are defined by the GO mutual semantic similarity while the fourth one by gene co-expression. As a general tool, feature distance on omics data is enabled by OmicsConv, a novel Keras layer, obtaining OmicsCNN, a dedicated deep learning framework. Here we demonstrate OmicsCNN on gut microbiota sequencing data, for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 16S data, first on synthetic data and then a metagenomics collection of gut microbiota of 222 IBD patients.},

Hundreds of diverse genes have been implicated in ASD; yet understanding how many genes, each with disparate function, can all be linked to a single clinical phenotype remains unclear. We hypothesized that understanding functional relationships between autism candidate genes during normal human brain development may provide convergent mechanistic insight into the genetic heterogeneity of ASD. We analyzed the co-expression relationships of 455 genes previously implicated in autism using the BrainSpan human transcriptome database, across 16 anatomical brain regions spanning prenatal life through adulthood. We discovered modules of ASD candidate genes with biologically relevant temporal co-expression dynamics, which were enriched for functional ontologies related to synaptogenesis, apoptosis, and GABA-ergic neurons. Furthermore, we also constructed co-expression networks from the entire transcriptome and found that ASD candidate genes were enriched in modules related to mitochondrial function, protein translation, and ubiquitination. Hub genes central to these ASD-enriched modules were further identified, and their functions supported these ontological findings. Overall, our multi-dimensional co-expression analysis of ASD candidate genes in the normal developing human brain suggests the heterogeneous set of ASD candidates share transcriptional networks related to synapse formation and elimination, protein turnover, and mitochondrial function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the umbrella term for a group of neurodevelopmental disorders convergent on behavioral phenotypes. While many genes have been implicated in the disorder, the predominant focus of previous research has been on protein coding genes. This leaves a vast number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) not characterized for their role in the disorder although lncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in development and are highly represented in the brain. Studies have also shown lncRNAs to be differentially expressed in ASD affected brains. However, there has yet to be an enrichment analysis of the shared ontologies and pathways of known ASD genes and lncRNAs in normal brain development.
RESULTS: In this study, we performed co-expression network analysis on the developing brain transcriptome to identify potential lncRNAs associated with ASD and possible annotations for functional role of lncRNAs in brain development. We found co-enrichment of lncRNA genes and ASD risk genes in two distinct groups of modules showing elevated prenatal and postnatal expression patterns, respectively. Further enrichment analysis of the module groups indicated that the early expression modules were comprised mainly of transcriptional regulators while the later expression modules were associated with synapse formation. Finally, lncRNAs were prioritized for their connectivity with the known ASD risk genes through analysis of an adjacency matrix. Collectively, the results imply early developmental repression of synaptic genes through lncRNAs and ASD transcriptional regulators.
CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate the utility of mining the publically available brain gene expression data to further functionally annotate the role of lncRNAs in ASD. Our analysis indicates that lncRNAs potentially have a key role in ASD due to their convergence on shared pathways, and we identify lncRNAs of interest that may lead to further avenues of study.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13229-017-0147-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are etiologically heterogeneous and complex. Functional genomics work has begun to identify a diverse array of dysregulated transcriptomic programs (e.g., synaptic, immune, cell cycle, DNA damage, WNT signaling, cortical patterning and differentiation) potentially involved in ASD brain abnormalities during childhood and adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether such diverse dysregulated pathways are independent of each other or instead reflect coordinated hierarchical systems-level pathology.
METHODS: Two ASD cortical transcriptome datasets were re-analyzed using consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify common co-expression modules across datasets. Linear mixed-effect models and Bayesian replication statistics were used to identify replicable differentially expressed modules. Eigengene network analysis was then utilized to identify between-group differences in how co-expression modules interact and cluster into hierarchical meta-modular organization. Protein-protein interaction analyses were also used to determine whether dysregulated co-expression modules show enhanced interactions.
RESULTS: We find replicable evidence for 10 gene co-expression modules that are differentially expressed in ASD cortex. Rather than being independent non-interacting sources of pathology, these dysregulated co-expression modules work in synergy and physically interact at the protein level. These systems-level transcriptional signals are characterized by downregulation of synaptic processes coordinated with upregulation of immune/inflammation, response to other organism, catabolism, viral processes, translation, protein targeting and localization, cell proliferation, and vasculature development. Hierarchical organization of meta-modules (clusters of highly correlated modules) is also highly affected in ASD.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight that dysregulation of the ASD cortical transcriptome is characterized by the dysregulation of multiple coordinated transcriptional programs producing synergistic systems-level effects that cannot be fully appreciated by studying the individual component biological processes in isolation.},

Three subgroups comprising 45–62\% of ASC adults show evidence for large impairments (Cohen’s d = −1.03 to −11.21), while other subgroups are effectively unimpaired. These findings delineate robust natural subdivisions within the ASC population that may allow for more individualized inferences and accelerate research towards precision medicine goals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many chromosomal regions for susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been identified, but few have reached genomewide significance. In response, researchers have attempted to increase the power of their analyses by stratifying samples to increase phenotypic homogeneity. Although homogeneity has typically been defined by a single variable, resultant groups often differ in other dimensions that may be directly pertinent. Group differences in age, gender, IQ, and measures of autism severity are examined as related to Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) domains previously used for subsetting or Quantitative Trait Analysis (QTL).
METHODS: Participants were research participants and clinic referrals for assessment of possible autism. Assessments included the ADI-R, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, and a developmental or cognitive test. Data were collected for 983 individuals, ages 4 to 52 years, with diagnoses of autism and ASDs.
RESULTS: Findings suggest that, of several potential grouping variables, only restricted and repetitive behaviors associated with Insistence on Sameness were independent of age, IQ, and autism severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Results emphasize the potential unintended effects of stratification and the importance of understanding such interrelationships between phenotypic characteristics when defining subgroups or performing QTL.},

Statistical analyses of gene expression data from control LCL against that of LCL from ASD probands identify genes for which expression levels are either quantitatively or qualitatively associated with phenotypic severity. Comparison of the significant differentially expressed genes from each subgroup relative to the control group reveals differentially expressed genes unique to each subgroup as well as genes in common across subgroups. Among the findings unique to the most severely affected ASD group are 15 genes that regulate circadian rhythm, which has been shown to have multiple effects on neurological as well as metabolic functions commonly dysregulated in autism. Among the genes common to all three subgroups of ASD are 20 novel genes mostly in putative noncoding regions, which appear to associate with androgen sensitivity and which may underlie the strong 4:1 bias toward affected males.},

The Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is one of the most widely used assessment instruments in the field of PDD. The current study investigated its factor structure and convergence with measures of adaptive, language, and intellectual functioning.
METHODS: Analyses were conducted on 1,861 individuals with PDD between the ages of 4 and 18 years (mean = 8.3, SD = 3.2). ADI-R scores were submitted to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Analyses were conducted according to verbal status (n = 1,329 verbal, n = 532 nonverbal) and separately for algorithm items only and for all items. ADI-R scores were correlated with scores on measures of adaptive, language, and intellectual functioning.
RESULTS: Several factor solutions were examined and compared. CFAs suggested that two- and three-factor solutions were similar, and slightly superior to a one-factor solution. EFAs and measures of internal consistency provided some support for a two-factor solution consisting of social and communication behaviors and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Measures of functioning were not associated with ADI-R domain scores in nonverbal children, but negatively correlated in verbal children.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, data suggested that autism symptomatology can be explained statistically with a two-domain model. It also pointed to different symptoms susceptible to be helpful in linkage analyses. Implications of a two-factor model are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background
The exact cause and mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear. Dysregulation of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) has been reported in the brains of ASD-like mutant mice and ASD brain tissues. However, the role and methylation of LINE-1 in individuals with ASD remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether LINE-1 insertion is associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to assess LINE-1 methylation in ASD.

Methods
To identify DEGs associated with LINE-1 in ASD, we reanalyzed previously published transcriptome profiles and overlapped them with the list of LINE-1-containing genes from the TranspoGene database. An Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of DEGs associated with LINE-1 insertion was conducted. DNA methylation of LINE-1 was assessed via combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) of lymphoblastoid cell lines from ASD individuals and unaffected individuals, and the methylation levels were correlated with the expression levels of LINE-1 and two LINE-1-inserted DEGs, C1orf27 and ARMC8.

Results
We found that LINE-1 insertion was significantly associated with DEGs in ASD. The IPA showed that LINE-1-inserted DEGs were associated with ASD-related mechanisms, including sex hormone receptor signaling and axon guidance signaling. Moreover, we observed that the LINE-1 methylation level was significantly reduced in lymphoblastoid cell lines from ASD individuals with severe language impairment and was inversely correlated with the transcript level. The methylation level of LINE-1 was also correlated with the expression of the LINE-1-inserted DEG C1orf27 but not ARMC8.

Conclusions
In ASD individuals with severe language impairment, LINE-1 methylation was reduced and correlated with the expression levels of LINE-1 and the LINE-1-inserted DEG C1orf27. Our findings highlight the association of LINE-1 with DEGs in ASD blood samples and warrant further investigation. The molecular mechanisms of LINE-1 and the effects of its methylation in ASD pathobiology deserve further study.},

	abstract = {Background
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are etiologically heterogeneous and complex. Functional genomics work has begun to identify a diverse array of dysregulated transcriptomic programs (e.g., synaptic, immune, cell cycle, DNA damage, WNT signaling, cortical patterning and differentiation) potentially involved in ASD brain abnormalities during childhood and adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether such diverse dysregulated pathways are independent of each other or instead reflect coordinated hierarchical systems-level pathology.

Methods
Two ASD cortical transcriptome datasets were re-analyzed using consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify common co-expression modules across datasets. Linear mixed-effect models and Bayesian replication statistics were used to identify replicable differentially expressed modules. Eigengene network analysis was then utilized to identify between-group differences in how co-expression modules interact and cluster into hierarchical meta-modular organization. Protein-protein interaction analyses were also used to determine whether dysregulated co-expression modules show enhanced interactions.

Results
We find replicable evidence for 10 gene co-expression modules that are differentially expressed in ASD cortex. Rather than being independent non-interacting sources of pathology, these dysregulated co-expression modules work in synergy and physically interact at the protein level. These systems-level transcriptional signals are characterized by downregulation of synaptic processes coordinated with upregulation of immune/inflammation, response to other organism, catabolism, viral processes, translation, protein targeting and localization, cell proliferation, and vasculature development. Hierarchical organization of meta-modules (clusters of highly correlated modules) is also highly affected in ASD.

Conclusions
These findings highlight that dysregulation of the ASD cortical transcriptome is characterized by the dysregulation of multiple coordinated transcriptional programs producing synergistic systems-level effects that cannot be fully appreciated by studying the individual component biological processes in isolation.

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome known to have a significant but complex genetic etiology. Hundreds of diverse genes have been implicated in ASD; yet understanding how many genes, each with disparate function, can all be linked to a single clinical phenotype remains unclear. We hypothesized that understanding functional relationships between autism candidate genes during normal human brain development may provide convergent mechanistic insight into the genetic heterogeneity of ASD. We analyzed the co-expression relationships of 455 genes previously implicated in autism using the BrainSpan human transcriptome database, across 16 anatomical brain regions spanning prenatal life through adulthood. We discovered modules of ASD candidate genes with biologically relevant temporal co-expression dynamics, which were enriched for functional ontologies related to synaptogenesis, apoptosis, and GABA-ergic neurons. Furthermore, we also constructed co-expression networks from the entire transcriptome and found that ASD candidate genes were enriched in modules related to mitochondrial function, protein translation, and ubiquitination. Hub genes central to these ASD-enriched modules were further identified, and their functions supported these ontological findings. Overall, our multi-dimensional co-expression analysis of ASD candidate genes in the normal developing human brain suggests the heterogeneous set of ASD candidates share transcriptional networks related to synapse formation and elimination, protein turnover, and mitochondrial function.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of complex neurodevelopmental conditions that present in early childhood and have a current estimated prevalence of about 1 in 68 US children, 1 in 42 boys. ASDs are heterogeneous, and arise from epigenetic, genetic and environmental origins, yet, the exact etiology of ASDs still remains unknown. Individuals with ASDs are characterized by having deficits in social interaction, impaired communication and a range of stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. Currently, a diagnosis of ASD is based solely on behavioral assessments and phenotype. Hundreds of diverse ASD susceptibility genes have been identified, yet none of the mutations found account for more than a small subset of autism cases. Therefore, a genetic diagnosis is not yet possible for the majority of the ASD population. The susceptibility genes that have been identified are involved in a wide and varied range of biological functions. Since the genetics of ASDs is so diverse, information on genome function as provided by transcriptomic data is essential to further our understanding. Gene expression studies have been extremely useful in comparing groups of individuals with ASD and control samples in order to measure which genes (or group of genes) are dysregulated in the ASD group. Transcriptomic studies are essential as a key link between measuring protein levels and analyzing genetic information. This review of recent autism gene expression studies highlights genes that are expressed in the brain, immune system, and processes such as cell metabolism and embryology. Various biological processes have been shown to be implicated with ASD individuals as well as differences in gene expression levels between different types of biological tissues. Some studies use gene expression to attempt to separate autism into different subtypes. An updated list of genes shown to be significantly dysregulated in individuals with autism from all recent ASD expression studies will help further research isolate any patterns useful for diagnosis or understanding the mechanisms involved. The functional relevance of transcriptomic studies as a method of classifying and diagnosing ASD cannot be underestimated despite the possible limitations of transcriptomic studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract In a research environment dominated by reductionist approaches to brain disease mechanisms, gene network analysis provides a complementary framework in which to tackle the complex dysregulations that occur in neuropsychiatric and other neurological disorders. Gene?gene expression correlations are a common source of molecular networks because they can be extracted from high-dimensional disease data and encapsulate the activity of multiple regulatory systems. However, the analysis of gene coexpression patterns is often treated as a mechanistic black box, in which looming ?hub genes? direct cellular networks, and where other features are obscured. By examining the biophysical bases of coexpression and gene regulatory changes that occur in disease, recent studies suggest it is possible to use coexpression networks as a multi-omic screening procedure to generate novel hypotheses for disease mechanisms. Because technical processing steps can affect the outcome and interpretation of coexpression networks, we examine the assumptions and alternatives to common patterns of coexpression analysis and discuss additional topics such as acceptable datasets for coexpression analysis, the robust identification of modules, disease-related prioritization of genes and molecular systems and network meta-analysis. To accelerate coexpression research beyond modules and hubs, we highlight some emerging directions for coexpression network research that are especially relevant to complex brain disease, including the centrality?lethality relationship, integration with machine learning approaches and network pharmacology.},

Numerous methods have been proposed to handle GWAS data. Most statistical methods have adopted a two-stage approach: pre-screening for dimensional reduction and variable selection to identify causal SNPs. The pre-screening step selects SNPs in terms of their P-values or the absolute values of the regression coefficients in single SNP analysis. Penalized regressions, such as the ridge, lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic-net regressions, are commonly used for the variable selection step.

	abstract = {Background
Genome-wide association studies involve detecting association between millions of genetic variants and a trait, which typically use univariate regression to test association between each single variant and the phenotype. Alternatively, Lasso penalized regression allows one to jointly model the relationship between all genetic variants and the phenotype. However, it is unclear how to best conduct inference on the individual Lasso coefficients, especially in high-dimensional settings.

Methods
We consider six methods for testing the Lasso coefficients: two permutation (Lasso-Ayers, Lasso-PL) and one analytic approach (Lasso-AL) to select the penalty parameter for type-1-error control, residual bootstrap (Lasso-RB), modified residual bootstrap (Lasso-MRB), and a permutation test (Lasso-PT). Methods are compared via simulations and application to the Minnesota Center for Twins and Family Study.

Results
We show that for finite sample sizes with increasing number of null predictors, Lasso-RB, Lasso-MRB, and Lasso-PT fail to be viable methods of inference. However, Lasso-PL and Lasso-AL remain fast and powerful tools for conducting inference with the Lasso, even in high-dimensions.

Conclusion
Our results suggest that the proposed permutation selection procedure (Lasso-PL) and the analytic selection method (Lasso-AL) are fast and powerful alternatives to the standard univariate analysis in genome-wide association studies.},

	abstract = {Salvia miltiorrhiza, known as Danshen, has attracted worldwide interest for its substantial effects on coronary heart disease (CHD). Danshensu (DSS) is one of the main active ingredients of Danshen on CHD. Although it has been proven to have a good clinical effect on CHD, the action mechanisms remain elusive. In the current study, a coexpression network-based approach was used to illustrate the beneficial properties of DSS in the context of CHD. By integrating the gene expression profile data and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) data, two coexpression protein interaction networks (CePIN) in a CHD state (CHD CePIN) and a non-CHD state (non-CHD CePIN) were generated. Then, shared nodes and unique nodes in CHD CePIN were attained by conducting a comparison between CHD CePIN and non-CHD CePIN. By calculating the topological parameters of each shared node and unique node in the networks, and comparing the differentially expressed genes, target proteins involved in disease regulation were attained. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment was utilized to identify biological processes associated to target proteins. Consequently, it turned out that the treatment of CHD with DSS may be partly attributed to the regulation of immunization and blood circulation. Also, it indicated that sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (SLC9A3), Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2), Oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1), and fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG) may be potential therapeutic targets for CHD. In summary, this study provided a novel coexpression protein interaction network approach to provide an explanation of the mechanisms of DSS on CHD and identify key proteins which maybe the potential therapeutic targets for CHD.},

Anisotropic diffusion across this weighted graph-structure with time is captured by the heat equation, and the solution, i.e. the heat kernel, is found by exponentiating the Laplacian eigensystem with time. Image smoothing is accomplished by convolving the heat kernel with the image, and its numerical implementation is realized by using the Krylov subspace technique. The method has the effect of smoothing within regions, but does not blur region boundaries. We also demonstrate the relationship between our method, standard diffusion-based PDEs, Fourier domain signal processing and spectral clustering.

Although Axin2 null mice are viable, we identified an unusual ENU-induced recessive allele of Axin2, canp, that causes midgestation lethality in homozygotes. We show that the Axin2(canp) mutation is a V26D substitution in an invariant N-terminal sequence motif and that the Axin2(canp) protein is more stable than wild type. As predicted for an increased level of a negative regulator, the Axin2(canp) mutation leads to decreased Wnt signaling in most tissues, and this can account for most of the morphological phenotypes of Axin2(canp) mutants. In contrast, there is a paradoxical increase in canonical Wnt activity in the late primitive streak of all Axin2(canp) mutant embryos that is associated with the formation of an ectopic tail in some mutants. Treatment of wild-type embryos with an inhibitor of Tankyrase that stabilizes Axin proteins also causes inhibition of Wnt signaling in anterior regions of the embryo and a gain of Wnt signaling in the primitive streak. The results indicate that although increased stability of Axin2 leads to a loss of canonical Wnt signaling in most tissues, stabilized Axin2 enhances Wnt pathway activity in a specific progenitor population in the late primitive streak.},

	abstract = {Targeted mouse mutants are instrumental for the analysis of gene function in health and disease. We recently provided proof-of-principle for the fast-track mutagenesis of the mouse genome, using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) in one-cell embryos. Here we report a routine procedure for the efficient production of disease-related knockin and knockout mutants, using improved TALEN mRNAs that include a plasmid-coded poly(A) tail (TALEN-95A), circumventing the problematic in vitro polyadenylation step. To knock out the C9orf72 gene as a model of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, TALEN-95A mutagenesis induced sequence deletions in 41\% of pups derived from microinjected embryos. Using TALENs together with mutagenic oligodeoxynucleotides, we introduced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient-derived missense mutations in the fused in sarcoma (Fus) gene at a rate of 6.8\%. For the simple identification of TALEN-induced mutants and their progeny we validate high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of PCR products as a sensitive and universal genotyping tool. Furthermore, HRMA of off-target sites in mutant founder mice revealed no evidence for undesired TALEN-mediated processing of related genomic sequences. The combination of TALEN-95A mRNAs for enhanced mutagenesis and of HRMA for simplified genotyping enables the accelerated, routine production of new mouse models for the study of genetic disease mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Expression of the bacterial beta-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ) in the vector used for the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) is driven by the endogenous promoter of the target gene. In tissues from KOMP mice, histochemical staining for LacZ enzyme activity can be used to determine gene expression patterns. With this technique, we have produced a comprehensive resource of gene expression using both whole mount (WM) and frozen section (FS) LacZ staining in 313 unique KOMP mutant mouse lines. Of these, ∼80\% of mutants showed specific staining in one or more tissues, while ∼20\% showed no specific staining, ∼13\% had staining in only one tissue, and ∼25\% had staining in {\textgreater}6 tissues. The highest frequency of specific staining occurred in the brain (∼50\%), male gonads (42\%), and kidney (39\%). The WM method was useful for rapidly identifying whole organ and some substructure staining, while the FS method often revealed substructure and cellular staining specificity. Both staining methods had {\textgreater}90\% repeatability in biological replicates. Nonspecific LacZ staining occurs in some tissues due to the presence of bacteria or endogenous enzyme activity. However, this can be effectively distinguished from reporter gene activity by the combination of the WM and FS methods. After careful annotation, LacZ staining patterns in a high percentage of mutants revealed a unique structure-function not previously reported for many of these genes. The validation of methods for LacZ staining, annotation, and expression analysis reported here provides unique insights into the function of genes for which little is currently known.},

We have utilized N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis to generate pedigrees of mutagenized mice that were subject to recurrent screens for mutant phenotypes as the mice aged. In total, we identify 105 distinct mutant lines from 157 pedigrees analysed, out of which 27 are late-onset phenotypes across a range of physiological systems. Using whole-genome sequencing we uncover the underlying genes for 44 of these mutant phenotypes, including 12 late-onset phenotypes. These genes reveal a number of novel pathways involved with age-related disease. We illustrate our findings by the recovery and characterization of a novel mouse model of age-related hearing loss.},

Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, we generated ChIP-seq data sets for a site-specific transcription factor (Suppressor of Hairy-wing) and a histone modification (H3K36me3). We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected. This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias. Paired-end sequencing revealed that single-end data underestimated ChIP-library complexity at high coverage. Removal of reads originating at the same base reduced false-positives but had little effect on detection sensitivity. Even at mappable-genome coverage depth of ∼1 read per base pair, ∼1\% of the narrow peaks detected on a tiling array were missed by ChIP-seq. Evaluation of widely used ChIP-seq analysis tools suggests that adjustments or algorithm improvements are required to handle data sets with deep coverage.},

Current strategies depend on conventional mapping, so the propagation of affected mice requires non-lethal screens; accurate tracking of phenotypes through pedigrees is complex and uncertain; out-crossing can introduce unexpected modifiers; and Sanger sequencing of candidate genes is inefficient. Here we show how these problems can be efficiently overcome using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to detect the ENU mutations and then identify regions that are identical by descent (IBD) in multiple affected mice. In this strategy, we use a modification of the Lander-Green algorithm to isolate causative recessive and dominant mutations, even at low coverage, on a pure strain background. Analysis of the IBD regions also allows us to calculate the ENU mutation rate (1.54 mutations per Mb) and to model future strategies for genetic screens in mice. The introduction of this approach will accelerate the discovery of causal variants, permit broader and more informative lethal screens to be used, reduce animal costs, and herald a new era for ENU mutagenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The processing and analysis of the large scale data generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments is challenging and is a burgeoning area of new methods development. Several new bioinformatics tools have been developed for calling sequence variants from NGS data. Here, we validate the variant calling of these tools and compare their relative accuracy to determine which data processing pipeline is optimal.
RESULTS: We developed a unified pipeline for processing NGS data that encompasses four modules: mapping, filtering, realignment and recalibration, and variant calling. We processed 130 subjects from an ongoing whole exome sequencing study through this pipeline. To evaluate the accuracy of each module, we conducted a series of comparisons between the single nucleotide variant (SNV) calls from the NGS data and either gold-standard Sanger sequencing on a total of 700 variants or array genotyping data on a total of 9,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. A head to head comparison showed that Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) provided more accurate calls than SAMtools (positive predictive value of 92.55\% vs. 80.35\%, respectively). Realignment of mapped reads and recalibration of base quality scores before SNV calling proved to be crucial to accurate variant calling. GATK HaplotypeCaller algorithm for variant calling outperformed the UnifiedGenotype algorithm. We also showed a relationship between mapping quality, read depth and allele balance, and SNV call accuracy. However, if best practices are used in data processing, then additional filtering based on these metrics provides little gains and accuracies of {\textgreater}99\% are achievable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will help to determine the best approach for processing NGS data to confidently call variants for downstream analyses. To enable others to implement and replicate our results, all of our codes are freely available at http://metamoodics.org/wes.},

However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper focuses on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.},

Computational analysis of phenotypes has therefore become critical for our ability to understand the biological meaning of genomic data in the biological sciences. At the heart of computational phenotype analysis are the phenotype ontologies. A large number of these ontologies have been developed across many domains, and we are now at a point where the knowledge captured in the structure of these ontologies can be used for the integration and analysis of large interrelated data sets. The Phenotype And Trait Ontology framework provides a method for formal definitions of phenotypes and associated data sets and has proved to be key to our ability to develop methods for the integration and analysis of phenotype data. Here, we describe the development and products of the ontological approach to phenotype capture, the formal content of phenotype ontologies and how their content can be used computationally.},

TAD predictions varied greatly between tools in number, size distribution and other biological properties. Assessed against a manual annotation of TADs, individual TAD boundary predictions were found to be quite reliable, but their assembly into complete TAD structures was much less so. In addition, many tools were sensitive to sequencing depth and resolution of the interaction frequency matrix. This manuscript provides users and designers of TAD prediction tools with information that will help guide the choice of tools and the interpretation of their predictions.},

A representative sample of working adults (n = 736) was presented with a list of interview questions that were either traditional (e.g., “Are you a good listener?”), behavioural (e.g., “Tell me about a time when you failed”), or brainteaser in nature. Results of a multiple regression, controlling for interviewing experience and sex, showed that narcissism and sadism explained the likelihood of using brainteasers in an interview. A subsequent bifactor analysis showed that these dark traits shared a callousness general factor. A second longitudinal study of employed adults with hiring experience demonstrated that perspective-taking partially mediated the relationship between this general factor and the perceived helpfulness and abusiveness of brainteaser interview questions. These results suggest that a callous indifference and a lack of perspective-taking may underlie abusive behaviour in the employment interview.},

Using data on human height in a US population of non-Hispanic whites, we illustrate how this method can be used to identify SNP networks from GWAS data, create network-specific polygenic scores, examine network topology to identify hub SNPs, and gain biological insights into complex traits. In our example, we show that this method explains a larger proportion of the variance in human height than traditional polygenic score methods. We also identify hub genes and pathways that have previously been identified as influencing human height. In moving forward, this method may be useful for generating genetic susceptibility measures for other health related traits, examining genetic pleiotropy, identifying at-risk individuals, examining gene score by environmental effects, and gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying biology of complex traits.},

	abstract = {Genomics has revolutionized biology, enabling the interrogation of whole transcriptomes, genome-wide binding sites for proteins, and many other molecular processes. However, individual genomic assays measure elements that interact in vivo as components of larger molecular machines. Understanding how these high-order interactions drive gene expression presents a substantial statistical challenge. Building on random forests (RFs) and random intersection trees (RITs) and through extensive, biologically inspired simulations, we developed the iterative random forest algorithm (iRF). iRF trains a feature-weighted ensemble of decision trees to detect stable, high-order interactions with the same order of computational cost as the RF. We demonstrate the utility of iRF for high-order interaction discovery in two prediction problems: enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of primary transcripts in human-derived cell lines. In Drosophila, among the 20 pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identifies as stable (returned in more than half of bootstrap replicates), 80\% have been previously reported as physical interactions. Moreover, third-order interactions, e.g., between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived cells, iRF rediscovered a central role of H3K36me3 in chromatin-mediated splicing regulation and identified interesting fifth- and sixth-order interactions, indicative of multivalent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing regulation. By decoupling the order of interactions from the computational cost of identification, iRF opens additional avenues of inquiry into the molecular mechanisms underlying genome biology.},

	abstract = {Suppose you are a physician with a patient whose complaint could arise from multiple diseases. To attain a specific diagnosis, you might ask yourself a series of yes/no questions depending on observed features describing the patient, such as clinical test results and reported symptoms. As some questions rule out certain diagnoses early on, each answer determines which question you ask next. With about a dozen features and extensive medical knowledge, you could create a simple flow chart to connect and order these questions. If you had observations of thousands of features instead, you would probably want to automate. Machine learning methods can learn which questions to ask about these features to classify the entity they describe. Even when we lack prior knowledge, a classifier can tell us which features are most important and how they relate to, or interact with, each other. Identifying interactions with large numbers of features poses a special challenge. In PNAS, Basu et al. (1) address this problem with a new classifier based on the widely used random forest technique. The new method, an iterative random forest algorithm (iRF), increases the robustness of random forest classifiers and provides a valuable new way to identify important feature interactions.

Random forests came into the spotlight in 2001 after their description by Breiman (2). He was largely influenced by previous work, especially the similar “randomized trees” method of Amit and Geman (3), as well as Ho’s “random decision forests” (4). Random forests have since proven useful in many fields due to their high predictive accuracy (5, 6). In biology and medicine, random forests have successfully tackled a range of problems, including predicting drug response in cancer cell lines (7), identifying DNA-binding proteins (8), and localizing cancer to particular tissues from a liquid biopsy (9). Random forests have also …

	abstract = {With the rise of both the number and the complexity of traits of interest, control of the false discovery rate (FDR) in genetic association studies has become an increasingly appealing and accepted target for multiple comparison adjustment. While a number of robust FDR-controlling strategies exist, the nature of this error rate is intimately tied to the precise way in which discoveries are counted, and the performance of FDR-controlling procedures is satisfactory only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between what scientists describe as unique discoveries and the number of rejected hypotheses. The presence of linkage disequilibrium between markers in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often leads researchers to consider the signal associated to multiple neighboring SNPs as indicating the existence of a single genomic locus with possible influence on the phenotype. This a posteriori aggregation of rejected hypotheses results in inflation of the relevant FDR. We propose a novel approach to FDR control that is based on prescreening to identify the level of resolution of distinct hypotheses. We show how FDR-controlling strategies can be adapted to account for this initial selection both with theoretical results and simulations that mimic the dependence structure to be expected in GWAS. We demonstrate that our approach is versatile and useful when the data are analyzed using both tests based on single markers and multiple regression. We provide an R package that allows practitioners to apply our procedure on standard GWAS format data, and illustrate its performance on lipid traits in the North Finland Birth Cohort 66 cohort study.},

	issn = {1471-2164},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-14-S3-S10},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that multivariate analysis and systematic detection of epistatic interactions between explanatory genotyping variables may help resolve the problem of "missing heritability" currently observed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, even the simplest bivariate analysis is still held back by significant statistical and computational challenges that are often addressed by reducing the set of analysed markers. Theoretically, it has been shown that combinations of loci may exist that show weak or no effects individually, but show significant (even complete) explanatory power over phenotype when combined. Reducing the set of analysed SNPs before bivariate analysis could easily omit such critical loci.
RESULTS: We have developed an exhaustive bivariate GWAS analysis methodology that yields a manageable subset of candidate marker pairs for subsequent analysis using other, often more computationally expensive techniques. Our model-free filtering approach is based on classification using ROC curve analysis, an alternative to much slower regression-based modelling techniques. Exhaustive analysis of studies containing approximately 450,000 SNPs and 5,000 samples requires only 2 hours using a desktop CPU or 13 minutes using a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). We validate our methodology with analysis of simulated datasets as well as the seven Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium datasets that represent a wide range of real life GWAS challenges. We have identified SNP pairs that have considerably stronger association with disease than their individual component SNPs that often show negligible effect univariately. When compared against previously reported results in the literature, our methods re-detect most significant SNP-pairs and additionally detect many pairs absent from the literature that show strong association with disease. The high overlap suggests that our fast analysis could substitute for some slower alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the proposed methodology is robust, fast and capable of exhaustive search for epistatic interactions using a standard desktop computer. First, our implementation is significantly faster than timings for comparable algorithms reported in the literature, especially as our method allows simultaneous use of multiple statistical filters with low computing time overhead. Second, for some diseases, we have identified hundreds of SNP pairs that pass formal multiple test (Bonferroni) correction and could form a rich source of hypotheses for follow-up analysis.

	abstract = {What proportion of genes with intense and selective expression in specific tissues, cells, or systems are still almost completely uncharacterized with respect to biological function? In what ways do these functionally enigmatic genes differ from well-studied genes? To address these two questions, we devised a computational approach that defines so-called ignoromes. As proof of principle, we extracted and analyzed a large subset of genes with intense and selective expression in brain. We find that publications associated with this set are highly skewed—the top 5\% of genes absorb 70\% of the relevant literature. In contrast, approximately 20\% of genes have essentially no neuroscience literature. Analysis of the ignorome over the past decade demonstrates that it is stubbornly persistent, and the rapid expansion of the neuroscience literature has not had the expected effect on numbers of these genes. Surprisingly, ignorome genes do not differ from well-studied genes in terms of connectivity in coexpression networks. Nor do they differ with respect to numbers of orthologs, paralogs, or protein domains. The major distinguishing characteristic between these sets of genes is date of discovery, early discovery being associated with greater research momentum—a genomic bandwagon effect. Finally we ask to what extent massive genomic, imaging, and phenotype data sets can be used to provide high-throughput functional annotation for an entire ignorome. In a majority of cases we have been able to extract and add significant information for these neglected genes. In several cases—ELMOD1, TMEM88B, and DZANK1—we have exploited sequence polymorphisms, large phenome data sets, and reverse genetic methods to evaluate the function of ignorome genes.},

The genes that are required for organismal survival are annotated as ‘essential genes’. Identifying all the essential genes of an animal species can reveal critical functions that are needed during the development of the organism. To inform studies on mouse development, we developed a supervised machine learning classifier based on phenotype data from mouse knockout experiments. We used this classifier to predict the essentiality of mouse genes lacking experimental data. Validation of our predictions against a blind test set of recent mouse knockout experimental data indicated a high level of accuracy ({\textgreater}80\%). We also validated our predictions for other mouse mutagenesis methodologies, demonstrating that the predictions are accurate for lethal phenotypes isolated in random chemical mutagenesis screens and embryonic stem cell screens. The biological functions that are enriched in essential and non-essential genes have been identified, showing that essential genes tend to encode intracellular proteins that interact with nucleic acids. The genome distribution of predicted essential and non-essential genes was analysed, demonstrating that the density of essential genes varies throughout the genome. A comparison with human essential and non-essential genes was performed, revealing conservation between human and mouse gene essentiality status. Our genome-wide predictions of mouse essential genes will be of value for the planning of mouse knockout experiments and phenotyping assays, for understanding the functional processes required during mouse development, and for the prioritisation of disease candidate genes identified in human genome and exome sequence datasets.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sleep is a critical process that is well-conserved across mammalian species, and perhaps most animals, yet its functions and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Identification of genes and pathways that can influence sleep may shed new light on these functions. Genomic screens enable the detection of previously unsuspected molecular processes that influence sleep. In this study, we report results from a large-scale phenotyping study of sleep-wake parameters for a population of single-gene knockout mice. Sleep-wake parameters were measured using a high throughput, non-invasive piezoelectric system called PiezoSleep. Knockout mice generated on a C57BL6/N (B6N) background were monitored for sleep and wake parameters for five days. By analyzing data from over 6000 mice representing 343 single gene knockout lines, we identified 122 genes influencing traits like sleep duration and bout length that have not been previously implicated in sleep, including those that affect sleep only during a specific circadian phase. PiezoSleep also allows assessment of breath rates during sleep and this was integrated as a supplemental tool in identifying aberrant physiology in these knockout lines. Sex differences were evident in both normal and altered sleep behavior. Through a combination of genetic and phenotypic associations, and known QTLs for sleep, we propose a set of candidate genes playing specific roles in sleep. The high hit-rate demonstrates that many genes can alter normal sleep behaviors through a variety of mechanisms. Further investigation of these genes may provide insight into the pathways regulating sleep, functional aspects of sleep, or indirect potentially pathological processes that alter normal sleep.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We identify 443,769 high-confidence pLoF variants in this cohort after filtering for sequencing and annotation artifacts. Using an improved model of human mutation, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum representing intolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve gene discovery power for both common and rare diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although their importance has been established in families with only one affected child (simplex families), the contribution of both de novo and inherited CNVs to ASD in families with multiple affected individuals (multiplex families) is less well understood. We analyzed 1,532 families from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) to assess the impact of de novo and rare CNVs on ASD risk in multiplex families. We observed a higher burden of large, rare CNVs, including inherited events, in individuals with ASD than in their unaffected siblings (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7), but the rate of de novo events was significantly lower than in simplex families. In previously characterized ASD risk loci, we identified 49 CNVs, comprising 24 inherited events, 19 de novo events, and 6 events of unknown inheritance, a significant enrichment in affected versus control individuals (OR = 3.3). In 21 of the 30 families (71\%) in whom at least one affected sibling harbored an established ASD major risk CNV, including five families harboring inherited CNVs, the CNV was not shared by all affected siblings, indicating that other risk factors are contributing. We also identified a rare risk locus for ASD and language delay at chromosomal region 2q24 (implicating NR4A2) and another lower-penetrance locus involving inherited deletions and duplications of WWOX. The genetic architecture in multiplex families differs from that in simplex families and is complex, warranting more complete genetic characterization of larger multiplex ASD cohorts.},

However, the nature and mechanisms of these pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of 232,964 cases and 494,162 controls from genome-wide studies of anorexia nervosa, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome. Genetic correlation analyses revealed a meaningful structure within the eight disorders identifying three groups of inter-related disorders. We detected 109 loci associated with at least two psychiatric disorders, including 23 loci with pleiotropic effects on four or more disorders and 11 loci with antagonistic effects on multiple disorders. The pleiotropic loci are located within genes that show heightened expression in the brain throughout the lifespan, beginning in the second trimester prenatally, and play prominent roles in a suite of neurodevelopmental processes. These findings have important implications for psychiatric nosology, drug development, and risk prediction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Studies comparing transcription in human and mouse have come to varied conclusions, in part because of their relatively small sample sizes or underpowered methodologies. To better characterize gene expression differences between mouse and human, we took a systems-biology approach by using weighted gene coexpression network analysis on more than 1,000 microarrays from brain. We find that global network properties of the brain transcriptome are highly preserved between species. Furthermore, all modules of highly coexpressed genes identified in mouse were identified in human, with those related to conserved cellular functions showing the strongest between-species preservation. Modules corresponding to glial and neuronal cells were sufficiently preserved between mouse and human to permit identification of cross species cell-class marker genes. We also identify several robust human-specific modules, including one strongly correlated with measures of Alzheimer disease progression across multiple data sets, whose hubs are poorly-characterized genes likely involved in Alzheimer disease. We present multiple lines of evidence suggesting links between neurodegenerative disease and glial cell types in human, including human-specific correlation of presenilin-1 with oligodendrocyte markers, and significant enrichment for known neurodegenerative disease genes in microglial modules. Together, this work identifies convergent and divergent pathways in mouse and human, and provides a systematic framework that will be useful for understanding the applicability of mouse models for human brain disorders.},

Bio-ontologies typically require multiple axes of classification to support the needs of their users. Development of such ontologies can only be made scalable and sustainable by the use of inference to automate classification via consistent patterns of axiomatization. Many bio-ontologies originating in OBO or OWL follow this approach. These patterns need to be documented in a form that requires minimal expertise to understand and edit and that can be validated and applied using any of the various programmatic approaches to working with OWL ontologies.

Results
Here we describe a system, Dead Simple OWL Design Patterns (DOS-DPs), which fulfills these requirements, illustrating the system with examples from the Gene Ontology.

Conclusions
The rapid adoption of DOS-DPs by multiple ontology development projects illustrates both the ease-of use and the pressing need for the simple design pattern system we have developed.},

	abstract = {The application of complex network modeling to analyze large co-expression data sets has gained traction during the last decade. In particular, the use of the weighted gene co-expression network analysis framework has allowed an unbiased and systems-level investigation of genotype-phenotype relationships in a wide range of systems. Since mouse is an important model organism for biomedical research on human disease, it is of great interest to identify similarities and differences in the functional roles of human and mouse orthologous genes. Here, we develop a novel network comparison approach which we demonstrate by comparing two gene-expression data sets from a large number of human and mouse tissues. The method uses weighted topological overlap alongside the recently developed network-decomposition method of s-core analysis, which is suitable for making gene-centrality rankings for weighted networks. The aim is to identify globally central genes separately in the human and mouse networks. By comparing the ranked gene lists, we identify genes that display conserved or diverged centrality-characteristics across the networks. This framework only assumes a single threshold value that is chosen from a statistical analysis, and it may be applied to arbitrary network structures and edge-weight distributions, also outside the context of biology. When conducting the comparative network analysis, both within and across the two species, we find a clear pattern of enrichment of transcription factors, for the homeobox domain in particular, among the globally central genes. We also perform gene-ontology term enrichment analysis and look at disease-related genes for the separate networks as well as the network comparisons. We find that gene ontology terms related to regulation and development are generally enriched across the networks. In particular, the genes FOXE3, RHO, RUNX2, ALX3 and RARA, which are disease genes in either human or mouse, are on the top-10 list of globally central genes in the human and mouse networks.},

To explore the genetic contribution to autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs), we have studied genomic copy-number variation in a large cohort of families with a single affected child and at least one unaffected sibling. We confirm a major contribution from de novo deletions and duplications but also find evidence of a role for inherited “ultrarare” duplications. Our results show that, relative to males, females have greater resistance to autism from genetic causes, which raises the question of the fate of female carriers. By analysis of the proportion and number of recurrent loci, we set a lower bound for distinct target loci at several hundred. We find many new candidate regions, adding substantially to the list of potential gene targets, and confirm several loci previously observed. The functions of the genes in the regions of de novo variation point to a great diversity of genetic causes but also suggest functional convergence.},

	abstract = {Plants are fascinating and complex organisms. A comprehensive understanding of the organization, function and evolution of plant genes is essential to disentangle important biological processes and to advance crop engineering and breeding strategies. The ultimate aim in deciphering complex biological processes is the discovery of causal genes and regulatory mechanisms controlling these processes. The recent surge of omics data has opened the door to a system-wide understanding of the flow of biological information underlying complex traits. However, dealing with the corresponding large data sets represents a challenging endeavor that calls for the development of powerful bioinformatics methods. A popular approach is the construction and analysis of gene networks. Such networks are often used for genome-wide representation of the complex functional organization of biological systems. Network based on similarity in gene expression are called (gene) co-expression networks. One of the major application of gene co-expression networks is the functional annotation of unknown genes. Constructing co-expression networks is generally straightforward. In contrast, the resulting network of connected genes can become very complex, which limits its biological interpretation. Several strategies can be employed to enhance the interpretation of the networks. A strategy in coherence with the biological question addressed needs to be established to infer reliable networks. Additional benefits can be gained from network-based strategies using prior knowledge and data integration to further enhance the elucidation of gene regulatory relationships. As a result, biological networks provide many more applications beyond the simple visualization of co-expressed genes. In this study we review the different approaches for co-expression network inference in plants. We analyse integrative genomics strategies used in recent studies that successfully identified candidate genes taking advantage of gene co-expression networks. Additionally, we discuss promising bioinformatics approaches that predict networks for specific purposes.},

	abstract = {By all accounts, President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) promising molecular-guided diagnostics, therapeutics, and prevention strategies is eliciting enthusiasm and excitement among clinicians, translational researchers, and patients (“NIH plots million-person megastudy,” J. Kaiser, In Depth, 20 February, p. [817][1]). To make this hope reality, the PMI Working Group of the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is holding workshops with stakeholders to discuss and resolve critical issues and challenges before launching NIH's \$200 million in funding initiatives later this year. Key to the PMI's success is how to gather, manage, and interpret for clinical benefit the unprecedented amounts of genomic, metabolomic, and other–omic data generated by the planned 1 million plus–person research cohort ([ 1 ][2]). There are many facets to this question, including: the advantages and disadvantages of holding patient data in federated and/or centralized databases; standardization of data generated by multiple testing regimens; deriving data both from electronic health records as well as metadata pertaining to environmental influences; ensuring access to and availability of patient data and information that is sufficiently deidentified to uphold privacy rights; curation and other data manipulation to ensure that data is organized and assembled into a format conducive to secondary and tertiary analyses; and sharing of data with national and international research groups.

Many of the issues regarding data management, accessibility, and interpretation first confronted the mouse research community in the Knockout Mouse Production and Phenotyping (KOMP2) project. KOMP2 was established as part of an international consortium [International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)] to provide a comprehensive description of function for each of the more than 21,000 protein coding genes in the mouse genome. Approaching 4 years into a planned 10-year NIH Common Fund timeline, KOMP2 and its global partners are using a common set of phenotyping tests covering 10 organ systems on sex-balanced cohorts of knockout mice ([ 2 ][3]). This process is similar to how the PMI will examine multiple cohorts of male and female patients according to an agreed-upon set of clinical assays across a broad spectrum of organ systems and disease phenotypes.

From a data management perspective, KOMP2 is now accomplishing in mice what the PMI seeks to accomplish in people. KOMP2 is successfully implementing collaborative solutions to address challenges with phenotyping data from globally distributed cohorts of mice. Biologists, software engineers, and research staff are working together to standardize data through harmonization of test protocols and identification of critical metadata. Access to results is facilitated by central curation of data, transparent statistical analysis, and real-time public posting of curated data from a central website ([www.mousephenotype.org][5]) ([ 3 ][6]). (Granted, the absence of privacy and informed consent concerns makes this process simpler for mice than for human studies.) Furthermore, our data meet guidelines for reproducibility of biomedical animal studies ([ 4 ][7]), and our statistical analysis platform is freely available for others to use ([ 5 ][8]).

In addition to data management, results from KOMP2 can provide substantial insight to inform the PMI's effort to define a new molecular taxonomy ([ 6 ][9]). Because we remain largely ignorant of the multiple functions of genes within the mammalian genome, revealing pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple seemingly unrelated traits) will generate vital new information on genes and disease ([ 7 ][10]). Undoubtedly, many variants of unknown significance will be identified in the PMI 1 million–person cohort. As a majority of genes to be studied by KOMP2 have little or no functional data, our ongoing studies are enabling discoveries beyond what we already know ([ 8 ][11]), revealing essential new knowledge to guide interpretation of the PMI studies planned in humans. As we journey together into this brave new world of precision medicine, we encourage and welcome cooperation of the PMI with KOMP2/IMPC.

	abstract = {The human brain is a tissue of vast complexity in terms of the cell types it comprises. Conventional approaches to classifying cell types in the human brain at single cell resolution have been limited to exploring relatively few markers and therefore have provided a limited molecular characterization of any given cell type. We used single cell RNA sequencing on 466 cells to capture the cellular complexity of the adult and fetal human brain at a whole transcriptome level. Healthy adult temporal lobe tissue was obtained during surgical procedures where otherwise normal tissue was removed to gain access to deeper hippocampal pathology in patients with medical refractory seizures. We were able to classify individual cells into all of the major neuronal, glial, and vascular cell types in the brain. We were able to divide neurons into individual communities and show that these communities preserve the categorization of interneuron subtypes that is typically observed with the use of classic interneuron markers. We then used single cell RNA sequencing on fetal human cortical neurons to identify genes that are differentially expressed between fetal and adult neurons and those genes that display an expression gradient that reflects the transition between replicating and quiescent fetal neuronal populations. Finally, we observed the expression of major histocompatibility complex type I genes in a subset of adult neurons, but not fetal neurons. The work presented here demonstrates the applicability of single cell RNA sequencing on the study of the adult human brain and constitutes a first step toward a comprehensive cellular atlas of the human brain.},

Spatiotemporal and cell type-specific analyses of the transcriptome, the sum total of all RNA transcripts in a cell or an organ, can provide insights into the role of genes in brain development and function, and their potential contribution to disorders of the brain. In the previous decade, advances in sequencing technology and funding from the National Institutes of Health and private foundations for large-scale genomics projects have led to a growing collection of brain transcriptome databases. These valuable resources provide rich and high-quality datasets with spatiotemporal, cell type-specific, and single-cell precision. Most importantly, many of these databases are publicly available via user-friendly web interface, making the information accessible to individual scientists without the need for advanced computational expertise. Here, we highlight key publicly available brain transcriptome databases, summarize the tissue sources and methods used to generate the data, and discuss their utility for neuroscience research.},

	abstract = {Transcriptome in brain plays a crucial role in understanding the cortical organization and the development of brain structure and function. Two challenges, the incomplete data and the high dimensionality of transcriptome, remain unsolved. Here we present a novel training scheme that successfully adapts the U-net architecture to the problem of volume recovery. By analogy to denoising autoencoder, we hide a portion of each training sample so that the network can learn to recover missing voxels from the context. Then on the completed volumes, we show that restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) can be used to infer co-occurrences among voxels, providing foundations for dividing the cortex into discrete subregions. As we stack multiple RBMs to form a deep belief network (DBN), we progressively map the high-dimensional raw input into abstract representations and create a hierarchy of transcriptome architecture. A coarse to fine organization emerges from the network layers. This organization incidentally corresponds to the anatomical structures, suggesting a close link between structures and the genetic underpinnings. Thus, we demonstrate a new way of learning transcriptome-based hierarchical organization using RBM and DBN.},

	abstract = {Migraine is a common disabling neurovascular brain disorder typically characterised by attacks of severe headache and associated with autonomic and neurological symptoms. Migraine is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over a dozen genetic loci associated with migraine. Here, we integrated migraine GWAS data with high-resolution spatial gene expression data of normal adult brains from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to identify specific brain regions and molecular pathways that are possibly involved in migraine pathophysiology. To this end, we used two complementary methods. In GWAS data from 23,285 migraine cases and 95,425 controls, we first studied modules of co-expressed genes that were calculated based on human brain expression data for enrichment of genes that showed association with migraine. Enrichment of a migraine GWAS signal was found for five modules that suggest involvement in migraine pathophysiology of: (i) neurotransmission, protein catabolism and mitochondria in the cortex; (ii) transcription regulation in the cortex and cerebellum; and (iii) oligodendrocytes and mitochondria in subcortical areas. Second, we used the high-confidence genes from the migraine GWAS as a basis to construct local migraine-related co-expression gene networks. Signatures of all brain regions and pathways that were prominent in the first method also surfaced in the second method, thus providing support that these brain regions and pathways are indeed involved in migraine pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Development of bioinformatic software for NGS has provided more opportunities for researchers to use various applications in genomic fields. De novo genome assembly and large scale DNA resequencing to understand genomic variations are popular genomic research tools for processing a tremendous amount of data at low cost. Studies on transcriptomes are now available, from previous-hybridization based microarray methods. Epigenetic studies are also available with NGS applications such as whole genome methylation sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. Human genetics has faced a new paradigm of research and medical genomics by sequencing technologies since the Human Genome Project. The trend of NGS technologies in human genomics has brought a new era of WGS by enabling the building of human genomes databases and providing appropriate human reference genomes, which is a necessary component of personalized medicine and precision medicine.},

The utility of "next-generation" sequencing has been found to establish the diagnosis for hundreds of genetic disorders, to assess pharmacogenomic variants, and to identify treatable targets within malignant neoplasms. The ready availability of genomic information has led to the question of whether there would be clinical benefit of sequencing the genome of individuals who are not seeking a diagnosis, that is, genomic screening in generally healthy people, to provide anticipatory insights for their health care. Little research has been conducted in this area. We examine the considerable unresolved scientific and ethical issues encountered when considering whole-genome sequencing of healthy people.},

Recent studies have implicated the cerebellum in these disorders, with post-mortem studies in ASD patients showing cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) loss, and isolated cerebellar injury has been associated with a higher incidence of ASDs. However, the extent of cerebellar contribution to the pathogenesis of ASDs remains unclear. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with high rates of comorbid ASDs that result from mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products dimerize and negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. TSC is an intriguing model to investigate the cerebellar contribution to the underlying pathogenesis of ASDs, as recent studies in TSC patients demonstrate cerebellar pathology and correlate cerebellar pathology with increased ASD symptomatology. Functional imaging also shows that TSC patients with ASDs display hypermetabolism in deep cerebellar structures, compared to TSC patients without ASDs. However, the roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in the cerebellum have not been investigated so far. Here we show that both heterozygous and homozygous loss of Tsc1 in mouse cerebellar PCs results in autistic-like behaviours, including abnormal social interaction, repetitive behaviour and vocalizations, in addition to decreased PC excitability. Treatment of mutant mice with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, prevented the pathological and behavioural deficits. These findings demonstrate new roles for Tsc1 in PC function and define a molecular basis for a cerebellar contribution to cognitive disorders such as autism.},

	abstract = {SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders associated with disturbances in communication, social interactions, cognition and affect. ASD are also accompanied by complex movement disorders, including ataxia. A special focus of recent research in this area is made on the striatum and the cerebellum, two structures known not only to control movement but also to be involved in cognitive functions such as memory and language. Dysfunction within the motor system may be associated with abnormal movements in ASD that are translated into ataxia, abnormal pattern of righting, gait sequencing, development of walking, and hand positioning. This line of study may generate new knowledge and understanding of motor symptoms associated with ASD and aims to deliver fresh perspectives for early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies against ASD.
AIMS OF THE REVIEW: Despite the relative paucity of research in this area (compared to the social, linguistic, and behavioural disturbances in ASD), there is evidence that the frontostriatal motor system and/or the cerebellar motor systems may be the site of dysfunction in ASD. Indeed, the cerebellum seems to be essential in the development of basic social capabilities, communication, repetitive/restrictive behaviors, and motor and cognitive behaviors that are all impaired in ASD. Cerebellar neuropathology including cerebellar hypoplasia and reduced cerebellar Purkinje cell numbers are the most consistent neuropathologies linked to ASD. The functional state of the cerebellum and its impact on brain function in ASD is the focus of this review. This review starts by recapitulating historical findings pointing towards an implication of the cerebellum, and to a lesser extent the basal ganglia structures, in TSA. We then detail the structure/function of the cerebellum at the regional and cellular levels before describing human and animal findings indicating a role of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in ASD.
HUMAN AND ANIMAL FINDINGS: Several studies have attempted to identify the nature of the motor system dysfunction in ASD, and it became apparent that the motor fronto-striatal and cerebellar systems are major sites of dysfunction in this psychiatric illness. Anomalies in these structures have been revealed both at the anatomical and functional levels in human patients as well as in animal models. These models are obtained by manipulation of genes that are often implicated in glutamate transmission, by lesions of brain structures among which the cerebellum, by pharmacological treatment with drugs such as the Valproate or by maternal infections with bacterial membrane extracts of double stranded RNA mimicking a viral infection.
CONCLUSION: The "cognitive approach" has dominated ASD research for three decades and led to the design of interventional strategies, which have yielded satisfactory results. Nevertheless, new approaches and alternative hypotheses on the aetiology and diagnosis of ASD are needed. Research focused on motor rather than psychiatric symptoms may have a greater potential to elucidate the neurobiological basis of ASD.},

The concept that the cerebellum is solely involved in fine motor function has become outdated; substantial evidence has accumulated linking the cerebellum with higher cognitive functions including language. Cerebellar deficits have been implicated in autism for more than two decades. The computational power of the cerebellum is essential for many, if not most of the processes that are perturbed in autism including language and communication, social interactions, stereotyped behavior, motor activity and motor coordination, and higher cognitive functions. The link between autism and cerebellar dysfunction should not be surprising to those who study its cellular, physiological, and functional properties. Postmortem studies have revealed neuropathological abnormalities in cerebellar cellular architecture while studies on mouse lines with cell loss or mutations in single genes restricted to cerebellar Purkinje cells have also strongly implicated this brain structure in contributing to the autistic phenotype. This connection has been further substantiated by studies investigating brain damage in humans restricted to the cerebellum.

The current paper proposes that impaired cerebello-cortical circuitry could, at least in part, underlie autistic symptoms. The use of animal models that allow for manipulation of genetic and environmental influences are an effective means of elucidating both distal and proximal etiological factors in autism and their potential impact on cerebello-cortical circuitry. Some existing rodent models of autism, as well as some models not previously applied to the study of the disorder, display cerebellar and behavioral abnormalities that parallel those commonly seen in autistic patients.

However, inferring genotypes from sequencing data is challenging, particularly for organisms with a high degree of heterozygosity. This is because genotype calls from sequencing data are often inaccurate due to low sequencing coverage, and if this is not accounted for, genotype uncertainty can lead to serious bias in downstream analyses, such as quantitative trait locus mapping and genome-wide association studies. Here, we used high-coverage reference data sets from Crassostrea gigas to simulate sequencing data with different coverage, and we evaluate the influence of genotype calling rate and accuracy as a function of coverage. Having initially identified the appropriate parameter settings for filtering to ensure genotype accuracy, we used two different single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling pipelines, single-sample and multi-sample. We found that a coverage of 15× was suitable for obtaining sufficient numbers of SNPs with high accuracy. Our work provides guidelines for the selection of sequence coverage when using NGS to investigate species with a high degree of heterozygosity and rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium.},

	abstract = {Objective
Our goal is to create an ontology that will allow data integration and reasoning with subject data to classify subjects, and based on this classification, to infer new knowledge on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). We take a first step toward this goal by extending an existing autism ontology to allow automatic inference of ASD phenotypes and Diagnostic \& Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria based on subjects’ Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessment data.
Materials and methods
Knowledge regarding diagnostic instruments, ASD phenotypes and risk factors was added to augment an existing autism ontology via Ontology Web Language class definitions and semantic web rules. We developed a custom Protégé plugin for enumerating combinatorial OWL axioms to support the many-to-many relations of ADI-R items to diagnostic categories in the DSM. We utilized a reasoner to infer whether 2642 subjects, whose data was obtained from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, meet DSM-IV-TR (DSM-IV) and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria based on their ADI-R data.
Results
We extended the ontology by adding 443 classes and 632 rules that represent phenotypes, along with their synonyms, environmental risk factors, and frequency of comorbidities. Applying the rules on the data set showed that the method produced accurate results: the true positive and true negative rates for inferring autistic disorder diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria were 1 and 0.065, respectively; the true positive rate for inferring ASD based on DSM-5 criteria was 0.94.
Discussion
The ontology allows automatic inference of subjects’ disease phenotypes and diagnosis with high accuracy.
Conclusion
The ontology may benefit future studies by serving as a knowledge base for ASD. In addition, by adding knowledge of related NDDs, commonalities and differences in manifestations and risk factors could be automatically inferred, contributing to the understanding of ASD pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multivariate statistics can assist in refining the nosology and diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) and also contribute important information for genetic studies. The Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is one of the most widely used assessment instruments in the field of PDD. The current study investigated its factor structure and convergence with measures of adaptive, language, and intellectual functioning.
METHODS: Analyses were conducted on 1,861 individuals with PDD between the ages of 4 and 18 years (mean = 8.3, SD = 3.2). ADI-R scores were submitted to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Analyses were conducted according to verbal status (n = 1,329 verbal, n = 532 nonverbal) and separately for algorithm items only and for all items. ADI-R scores were correlated with scores on measures of adaptive, language, and intellectual functioning.
RESULTS: Several factor solutions were examined and compared. CFAs suggested that two- and three-factor solutions were similar, and slightly superior to a one-factor solution. EFAs and measures of internal consistency provided some support for a two-factor solution consisting of social and communication behaviors and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Measures of functioning were not associated with ADI-R domain scores in nonverbal children, but negatively correlated in verbal children.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, data suggested that autism symptomatology can be explained statistically with a two-domain model. It also pointed to different symptoms susceptible to be helpful in linkage analyses. Implications of a two-factor model are discussed.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews clinical and scientific approaches to optic ataxia. This double historic track allows us to address important issues such as the link between Bálint syndrome and optic ataxia, the alleged double dissociation between optic ataxia and visual agnosia, and the use of optic ataxia to argue for a specific vision-for-action occipitoposterior parietal stream. Clinical cases are described and reveal that perceptual deficits have been long shown to accompany ataxia. Importantly, the term ataxia appears to be misleading as patients exhibit a combination of visual and nonvisual perceptual, attentional, and visuomotor guidance deficits, which are confirmed by experimental approaches. Three major features of optic ataxia are described. The first is a spatial feature whereby the deficits exhibited by patients appear to be specific to peripheral vision, akin to the field effect. Visuomotor field examination allows us to quantify this deficit and reveals that it consists of a highly reliable retinocentric hypometria. The third is a temporal feature whereby these deficits are exacerbated under temporal constraints, i.e., when attending to dynamic stimuli. These two aspects combine in a situation where patients have to quickly respond to a target presented in peripheral vision that is experimentally displaced upon movement onset. In addition to the field effect, a hand effect can be described in conditions where the hand is not visible. Spatial and temporal aspects as well as field and hand effects may rely on several posterior parietal modules that remain to be precisely identified both anatomically and functionally. It is concluded that optic ataxia is not a visuomotor deficit and there is no dissociation between perception and action capacities in optic ataxia, hence a fortiori no double dissociation between optic ataxia and visual agnosia. Future directions for understanding the basic pathophysiology of optic ataxia are proposed.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Many important observations have been published in recent years in connection with primary ataxias, particularly new loci and genes. The most commonly inherited ataxias may present with typical and atypical phenotypes. In the group of idiopathic degenerative ataxias, genes have been found in patients with multiple system atrophy type C. Secondary ataxias represent an important group of sporadic, cerebellar, and afferent/sensory ataxias.
SUMMARY: Knowledge of primary ataxias has been growing rapidly in recent years. Here we review different forms of primary ataxia, including inherited forms, which are subdivided into congenital, autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias, autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, episodic ataxias, X-linked ataxias, and mitochondrial ataxias, as well as sporadic ataxias and idiopathic degenerative ataxias. Secondary or acquired ataxias are also reviewed and the most common causes are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Reproducibility of a research is a key element in the modern science and it is mandatory for any industrial application. It represents the ability of replicating an experiment independently by the location and the operator. Therefore, a study can be considered reproducible only if all used data are available and the exploited computational analysis workflow is clearly described. However, today for reproducing a complex bioinformatics analysis, the raw data and a list of tools used in the workflow could be not enough to guarantee the reproducibility of the results obtained. Indeed, different releases of the same tools and/or of the system libraries (exploited by such tools) might lead to sneaky reproducibility issues. Results: To address this challenge, we established the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project (RBP), which is a non-profit and open-source project, whose aim is to provide a schema and an infrastructure, based on docker images and R package, to provide reproducible results in Bioinformatics. One or more Docker images are then defined for a workflow (typically one for each task), while the workflow implementation is handled via R-functions embedded in a package available at github repository. Thus, a bioinformatician participating to the project has firstly to integrate her/his workflow modules into Docker image(s) exploiting an Ubuntu docker image developed ad hoc by RPB to make easier this task. Secondly, the workflow implementation must be realized in R according to an R-skeleton function made available by RPB to guarantee homogeneity and reusability among different RPB functions. Moreover she/he has to provide the R vignette explaining the package functionality together with an example dataset which can be used to improve the user confidence in the workflow utilization. Conclusions: Reproducible Bioinformatics Project provides a general schema and an infrastructure to distribute robust and reproducible workflows. Thus, it guarantees to final users the ability to repeat consistently any analysis independently by the used UNIX-like architecture.},

	abstract = {Background
Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) loss, gain, and reshuffling within the sequence of a regulatory element could alter the function of that regulatory element. Some of the changes will be detrimental to the fitness of the species and will result in gradual removal from a population, while other changes would be either beneficial or just a part of genetic drift and end up being fixed in a population. This “reprogramming” of regulatory elements results in modification of the gene regulatory landscape during evolution.

Results
We identified reprogrammed enhancers (RPEs) by comparing the distribution of tissue-specific enhancers in the human and mouse genomes. We observed that around 30\% of mammalian enhancers have been reprogrammed after the human-mouse speciation. In 79\% of cases, the reprogramming of an enhancer resulted in a quantifiably different expression of a flanking gene. In the case of the Thy-1 cell surface antigen gene, for example, enhancer reprogramming is associated with cortex to thymus change in gene expression. To understand the mechanisms of enhancer reprogramming, we profiled the evolutionary changes in the TFBS enhancer content and found that enhancer reprogramming took place through the acquisition of new TFBSs in 72\% of reprogramming events.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that enhancer reprogramming takes place within well-established regulatory loci with RPEs contributing additively to fine-tuning of the gene regulatory program in mammals. We also found evidence for acquisition of novel gene function through enhancer reprogramming, which allows expansion of gene regulatory landscapes into new regulatory domains.

The addition of published CNV data from the Autism Genome Project (AGP) and exome sequencing data from the SSC and the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) shows that genes within small de novo deletions, but not within large dnCNVs, significantly overlap the high-effect risk genes identified by sequencing. Alternatively, large dnCNVs are found likely to contain multiple modest-effect risk genes. Overall, we find strong evidence that de novo mutations are associated with ASD apart from the risk for intellectual disability. Extending the transmission and de novo association test (TADA) to include small de novo deletions reveals 71 ASD risk loci, including 6 CNV regions (noted above) and 65 risk genes (FDR ≤ 0.1).},

We compare properties of tissue-specific genes and drug targets. We show that tissue-specificity of the target may also be related to efficacy of the drug. The relationship may be indirect (enrichment in Mendelian disease genes) or direct (elevated ability to spread perturbations in human protein-protein interactome for tissue-specifically produced enzymes and secreted proteins). Reduced evolutionary conservation of tissue-specific genes may represent a bottleneck for drug projects, prompting development of novel models with smaller evolutionary gap to humans.

The animal model (AM) module of AutDB was first developed for mouse models of genes and CNVs associated with ASD (Kumar et al., 2011). Subsequently, environmentally induced rodent models were introduced to capture the full spectrum of risk-factors associated with ASD, along with idiopathic models represented by inbred strains. Using the data systematically annotated in AutDB, we depict the intricate trends in the research findings based on rodent models of ASD. We identify the top 30 most frequently studied phenotypes extracted from 911 genetic, 269 induced and 17 inbred rodent models of ASD extracted from 787 publications. As expected, many of these include animal model equivalents of the core phenotypes associated with ASD, as well as several comorbid features of ASD including anxiety, seizures and motor-control deficits. Uniquely, AutDB curates rescue models where various treatment strategies were used in rodent ASD models to alleviate ASD-relevant phenotypes. We further examine ASD models based on 52 genes and 2 CNV loci to identify 24 pharmaceutical agents that were used in 2 or more paradigms for testing their efficacy. As a case study, we analyze various Shank3 mouse models providing a high-resolution view of the in vivo role of this high-confidence ASD gene. Together, this resource provides a snapshot of genetic and induced models of ASD within a shared annotation platform to examine the complex meshing of diverse ASD-associated risk-factors.},

Relatively minor changes in the structure of c-Myb protein change the genes that it regulates and can unleash its latent transforming activities. Here, quantitative assays were used to analyze the alternative splicing of human c-myb transcripts. We identified an array of variant transcripts, expressed in highly regulated, lineage-specific patterns, that were formed through the use of alternate exons 8A, 9A, 9B, 10A, 13A, and 14A. Expression levels of the different splice variant transcripts were regulated independently of one another during human hematopoietic cell differentiation, and the alternative splicing of c-myb mRNAs was increased in primary leukemia samples. The alternatively spliced c-myb transcripts were associated with polysomes and encoded a series of c-Myb proteins with identical DNA binding domains but unique C-terminal domains. In several types of assays, the variant c-Myb proteins exhibited quantitative and qualitative differences in transcriptional activities and specificities. The results suggest that the human c-myb gene encodes a family of related proteins with different transcriptional activities. Enhanced alternative splicing may be a mechanism for unmasking the transforming activity of c-myb in human leukemias.},

	abstract = {Establishing standard operating procedures (SOPs) as tools for the analysis of behavioral phenotypes is fundamental to mouse functional genomics. It is essential that the tests designed provide reliable measures of the process under investigation but most importantly that these are reproducible across both time and laboratories. For this reason, we devised and tested a set of SOPs to investigate mouse behavior. Five research centers were involved across France, Germany, Italy, and the UK in this study, as part of the EUMORPHIA program. All the procedures underwent a cross-validation experimental study to investigate the robustness of the designed protocols. Four inbred reference strains (C57BL/6J, C3HeB/FeJ, BALB/cByJ, 129S2/SvPas), reflecting their use as common background strains in mutagenesis programs, were analyzed to validate these tests. We demonstrate that the operating procedures employed, which includes open field, SHIRPA, grip-strength, rotarod, Y-maze, prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response, and tail flick tests, generated reproducible results between laboratories for a number of the test output parameters. However, we also identified several uncontrolled variables that constitute confounding factors in behavioral phenotyping. The EUMORPHIA SOPs described here are an important start-point for the ongoing development of increasingly robust phenotyping platforms and their application in large-scale, multicentre mouse phenotyping programs.},

	abstract = {Conditional gene manipulations in mice are increasingly popular strategies in biomedical research. These approaches rely on the production of conditional genetically engineered mutant mouse (GEMM) lines with mutations in protein-encoding genes. These conditional GEMMs are then bred with one or several transgenic mouse lines expressing a site-specific recombinase, most often the Cre recombinase, in a tissue-specific manner. Conditional GEMMs can only be exploited if Cre transgenic mouse lines are available to generate somatic mutations, and thus the number of Cre transgenic lines has significantly increased over the last 15 years. Once produced, these transgenic lines must be validated for reliable, efficient, and specific Cre expression and Cre-mediated recombination. In this overview, the minimum level of information that is ideally required to validate a Cre-driver transgenic line is first discussed. The vagaries associated with validation procedures are considered next, and some solutions are proposed to assess the expression and activity of constitutive or inducible Cre recombinase before undertaking extensive breeding experiments and exhaustive phenotyping.

	shorttitle = {Signatures of inflammation and impending multiple organ dysfunction in the hyperacute phase of trauma},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.1002352},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe trauma induces a widespread response of the immune system. This "genomic storm" can lead to poor outcomes, including Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). MODS carries a high mortality and morbidity rate and adversely affects long-term health outcomes. Contemporary management of MODS is entirely supportive, and no specific therapeutics have been shown to be effective in reducing incidence or severity. The pathogenesis of MODS remains unclear, and several models are proposed, such as excessive inflammation, a second-hit insult, or an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. We postulated that the hyperacute window after trauma may hold the key to understanding how the genomic storm is initiated and may lead to a new understanding of the pathogenesis of MODS.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed whole blood transcriptome and flow cytometry analyses on a total of 70 critically injured patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] ≥ 25) at The Royal London Hospital in the hyperacute time period within 2 hours of injury. We compared transcriptome findings in 36 critically injured patients with those of 6 patients with minor injuries (ISS ≤ 4). We then performed flow cytometry analyses in 34 critically injured patients and compared findings with those of 9 healthy volunteers. Immediately after injury, only 1,239 gene transcripts (4\%) were differentially expressed in critically injured patients. By 24 hours after injury, 6,294 transcripts (21\%) were differentially expressed compared to the hyperacute window. Only 202 (16\%) genes differentially expressed in the hyperacute window were still expressed in the same direction at 24 hours postinjury. Pathway analysis showed principally up-regulation of pattern recognition and innate inflammatory pathways, with down-regulation of adaptive responses. Immune deconvolution, flow cytometry, and modular analysis suggested a central role for neutrophils and Natural Killer (NK) cells, with underexpression of T- and B cell responses. In the transcriptome cohort, 20 critically injured patients later developed MODS. Compared with the 16 patients who did not develop MODS (NoMODS), maximal differential expression was seen within the hyperacute window. In MODS versus NoMODS, 363 genes were differentially expressed on admission, compared to only 33 at 24 hours postinjury. MODS transcripts differentially expressed in the hyperacute window showed enrichment among diseases and biological functions associated with cell survival and organismal death rather than inflammatory pathways. There was differential up-regulation of NK cell signalling pathways and markers in patients who would later develop MODS, with down-regulation of neutrophil deconvolution markers. This study is limited by its sample size, precluding more detailed analyses of drivers of the hyperacute response and different MODS phenotypes, and requires validation in other critically injured cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed how the hyperacute postinjury time window contained a focused, specific signature of the response to critical injury that led to widespread genomic activation. A transcriptomic signature for later development of MODS was present in this hyperacute window; it showed a strong signal for cell death and survival pathways and implicated NK cells and neutrophil populations in this differential response.},

However, genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies explain less than 10\% of the total trait variability. Some have argued that the equal environment assumption for the classical twin model might be invalid, resulting in inflated narrow-sense heritability (h
2) estimates, thus explaining part of the ‘missing h
2’. Genomic relatedness restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) estimation overcomes this issue. This method uses both family data and genome-wide coverage of common SNPs to determine the degree of relatedness between individuals to estimate both h
2 explained by common SNPs and total h
2. The aim of the current study is to characterize more reliably than previously possible ECG trait h
2 using GREML estimation, and to compare these outcomes to those of the classical twin model. We analyzed ECG traits (heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, RV5+SV1, QTc interval, Sokolow-Lyon product, and Cornell product) in up to 3,133 twins from the TwinsUK cohort and derived h
2 estimates by both methods. GREML yielded h
2 estimates between 47\% and 68\%. Classical twin modeling provided similar h
2 estimates, except for the Cornell product, for which the best fit included no genetic factors. We found no evidence that the classical twin model leads to inflated h
2 estimates. Therefore, our study confirms the validity of the equal environment assumption for monozygotic and dizygotic twins and supports the robust basis for future studies exploring genetic variants responsible for the variance of ECG traits.},

	abstract = {Background
Several semantic similarity measures have been applied to gene products annotated with Gene Ontology terms, providing a basis for their functional comparison. However, it is still unclear which is the best approach to semantic similarity in this context, since there is no conclusive evaluation of the various measures. Another issue, is whether electronic annotations should or not be used in semantic similarity calculations.

Results
We conducted a systematic evaluation of GO-based semantic similarity measures using the relationship with sequence similarity as a means to quantify their performance, and assessed the influence of electronic annotations by testing the measures in the presence and absence of these annotations. We verified that the relationship between semantic and sequence similarity is not linear, but can be well approximated by a rescaled Normal cumulative distribution function. Given that the majority of the semantic similarity measures capture an identical behaviour, but differ in resolution, we used the latter as the main criterion of evaluation.

Conclusions
This work has provided a basis for the comparison of several semantic similarity measures, and can aid researchers in choosing the most adequate measure for their work. We have found that the hybrid simGIC was the measure with the best overall performance, followed by Resnik's measure using a best-match average combination approach. We have also found that the average and maximum combination approaches are problematic since both are inherently influenced by the number of terms being combined. We suspect that there may be a direct influence of data circularity in the behaviour of the results including electronic annotations, as a result of functional inference from sequence similarity.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this consensus paper is to review electrophysiological abnormalities and to provide a guideline of neurophysiological assessments in cerebellar ataxias. All authors agree that standard electrophysiological methods should be systematically applied in all cases of ataxia to reveal accompanying peripheral neuropathy, the involvement of the dorsal columns, pyramidal tracts and the brainstem. Electroencephalography should also be considered, although findings are frequently non-specific. Electrophysiology helps define the neuronal systems affected by the disease in an individual patient and to understand the phenotypes of the different types of ataxia on a more general level. As yet, there is no established electrophysiological measure which is sensitive and specific of cerebellar dysfunction in ataxias. The authors agree that cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI), which is based on a paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm assessing cerebellar-cortical connectivity, is likely a useful measure of cerebellar function. Although its role in the investigation and diagnoses of different types of ataxias is unclear, it will be of interest to study its utility in this type of conditions. The authors agree that detailed clinical examination reveals core features of ataxia (i.e., dysarthria, truncal, gait and limb ataxia, oculomotor dysfunction) and is sufficient for formulating a differential diagnosis. Clinical assessment of oculomotor function, especially saccades and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) which are most easily examined both at the bedside and with quantitative testing techniques, is of particular help for differential diagnosis in many cases. Pure clinical measures, however, are not sensitive enough to reveal minute fluctuations or early treatment response as most relevant for pre-clinical stages of disease which might be amenable to study in future intervention trials. The authors agree that quantitative measures of ataxia are desirable as biomarkers. Methods are discussed that allow quantification of ataxia in laboratory as well as in clinical and real-life settings, for instance at the patients' home. Future studies are needed to demonstrate their usefulness as biomarkers in pharmaceutical or rehabilitation trials.},

	abstract = {Many diseases involve the cerebellum and produce ataxia, which is characterized by incoordination of balance, gait, extremity and eye movements, and dysarthria. Cerebellar lesions do not always manifest with ataxic motor syndromes, however. The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) includes impairments in executive, visual-spatial, and linguistic abilities, with affective disturbance ranging from emotional blunting and depression, to disinhibition and psychotic features. The cognitive and psychiatric components of the CCAS, together with the ataxic motor disability of cerebellar disorders, are conceptualized within the dysmetria of thought hypothesis. This concept holds that a universal cerebellar transform facilitates automatic modulation of behavior around a homeostatic baseline, and the behavior being modulated is determined by the specificity of anatomic subcircuits, or loops, within the cerebrocerebellar system. Damage to the cerebellar component of the distributed neural circuit subserving sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional processing disrupts the universal cerebellar transform, leading to the universal cerebellar impairment affecting the lesioned domain. The universal cerebellar impairment manifests as ataxia when the sensorimotor cerebellum is involved and as the CCAS when pathology is in the lateral hemisphere of the posterior cerebellum (involved in cognitive processing) or in the vermis (limbic cerebellum). Cognitive and emotional disorders may accompany cerebellar diseases or be their principal clinical presentation, and this has significance for the diagnosis and management of patients with cerebellar dysfunction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a widely used R software package for the generation of gene co-expression networks (GCN). WGCNA generates both a GCN and a derived partitioning of clusters of genes (modules). We propose k-means clustering as an additional processing step to conventional WGCNA, which we have implemented in the R package km2gcn (k-means to gene co-expression network, https://github.com/juanbot/km2gcn ).
RESULTS: We assessed our method on networks created from UKBEC data (10 different human brain tissues), on networks created from GTEx data (42 human tissues, including 13 brain tissues), and on simulated networks derived from GTEx data. We observed substantially improved module properties, including: (1) few or zero misplaced genes; (2) increased counts of replicable clusters in alternate tissues (x3.1 on average); (3) improved enrichment of Gene Ontology terms (seen in 48/52 GCNs) (4) improved cell type enrichment signals (seen in 21/23 brain GCNs); and (5) more accurate partitions in simulated data according to a range of similarity indices.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from our investigations indicate that our k-means method, applied as an adjunct to standard WGCNA, results in better network partitions. These improved partitions enable more fruitful downstream analyses, as gene modules are more biologically meaningful.},

	abstract = {Estimation and testing of genetic effects (genotype relative risks) are often performed conditionally on parental genotypes, using data from case-parent trios. This strategy avoids having to estimate nuisance parameters such as parental mating type frequencies, and also avoids generating spurious results due to confounding causes of association such as population stratification. For effects at a single locus, the resulting analysis is equivalent to matched case/control analysis via conditional logistic regression, using the case and three "pseudocontrols" derived from the untransmitted parental alleles. We previously showed that a similar approach can be used for analyzing genotype and haplotype effects at a set of closely linked loci, but with a required adjustment to the conditioning argument that results in varying numbers of pseudocontrols, depending on the disease model that is to be fitted. Here we extend this method to include the analysis of epistatic effects (gene-gene interactions) at unlinked loci, to include parent-of-origin effects at one or more loci, and to allow additional incorporation of gene-environment interactions. The conditional logistic approach provides a natural and flexible framework for incorporating these additional effects. By relaxing the conditioning on parental genotypes to allow exchangeability of parental genotypes, we show how the power of this approach can be increased when studying parent-of-origin effects. Simulations suggest that there is limited power to distinguish between parent-of-origin effects and effects due to interaction between genotypes of mother and child.},

Pan-cancer analyses have been performed for adult but not paediatric cancers, which commonly occur in developing mesodermic rather than adult epithelial tissues. Here we present a pan-cancer study of somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variants, small insertions or deletions, structural variations, copy number alterations, gene fusions and internal tandem duplications in 1,699 paediatric leukaemias and solid tumours across six histotypes, with whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing data processed under a uniform analytical framework. We report 142 driver genes in paediatric cancers, of which only 45\% match those found in adult pan-cancer studies; copy number alterations and structural variants constituted the majority (62\%) of events. Eleven genome-wide mutational signatures were identified, including one attributed to ultraviolet-light exposure in eight aneuploid leukaemias. Transcription of the mutant allele was detectable for 34\% of protein-coding mutations, and 20\% exhibited allele-specific expression. These data provide a comprehensive genomic architecture for paediatric cancers and emphasize the need for paediatric cancer-specific development of precision therapies.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-14-514},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput omics technologies such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have become indispensable tools in biological research. Computational analysis and biological interpretation of omics data can pose significant challenges due to a number of factors, in particular the systems integration required to fully exploit and compare data from different studies and/or technology platforms. In transcriptomics, the identification of differentially expressed genes when studying effect(s) or contrast(s) of interest constitutes the starting point for further downstream computational analysis (e.g. gene over-representation/enrichment analysis, reverse engineering) leading to mechanistic insights. Therefore, it is important to systematically store the full list of genes with their associated statistical analysis results (differential expression, t-statistics, p-value) corresponding to one or more effect(s) or contrast(s) of interest (shortly termed as " contrast data") in a comparable manner and extract gene sets in order to efficiently support downstream analyses and further leverage data on a long-term basis. Filling this gap would open new research perspectives for biologists to discover disease-related biomarkers and to support the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying specific biological perturbation effects (e.g. disease, genetic, environmental, etc.).
RESULTS: To address these challenges, we developed Confero, a contrast data and gene set platform for downstream analysis and biological interpretation of omics data. The Confero software platform provides storage of contrast data in a simple and standard format, data transformation to enable cross-study and platform data comparison, and automatic extraction and storage of gene sets to build new a priori knowledge which is leveraged by integrated and extensible downstream computational analysis tools. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) are currently integrated as an analysis module as well as additional tools to support biological interpretation. Confero is a standalone system that also integrates with Galaxy, an open-source workflow management and data integration system. To illustrate Confero platform functionality we walk through major aspects of the Confero workflow and results using the Bioconductor estrogen package dataset.
CONCLUSION: Confero provides a unique and flexible platform to support downstream computational analysis facilitating biological interpretation. The system has been designed in order to provide the researcher with a simple, innovative, and extensible solution to store and exploit analyzed data in a sustainable and reproducible manner thereby accelerating knowledge-driven research.

The Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MPO), a structured vocabulary of phenotype terms that leverages observations encompassing the consequences of mouse gene knockout studies, is a principal component of mouse phenotype knowledge source. On the other hand, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a composite collection of various human-centered biomedical terminologies. In the present study, we mapped terms reciprocally from the MPO to human disease concepts such as clinical findings from the UMLS and clinical phenotypes from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man knowledgebase. By cross-mapping mouse-human phenotype terms, extracting implicated genes and extrapolating phenotype-gene associations between species PhenoHM provides a resource that enables rapid identification of genes that trigger similar outcomes in human and mouse and facilitates identification of potentially novel disease causal genes.

The "lasso" minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant.

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate lipidomic differences between breast- and formula-fed infants.
STUDY DESIGN: We utilized high-resolution mass-spectrometry methods to analyze 3.2 mm dried blood spot samples collected at ages 3 months (n = 241) and 12 months (n = 144) from a representative birth cohort study. Lipidomic profiles were compared between infants exclusively breast-fed, formula-fed, or mixed-fed, and related to 12-month infancy weight. Data analysis included supervised multivariate statistics (partial least squares discriminant analysis), and univariate analysis with correction for multiple testing.
RESULTS: Distinct differences in 3-month lipidomic profiles were observed between exclusively breast-fed and formula-fed infants; mixed-fed infants showed intermediate profiles. Principle lipidomic characteristics of breast-fed infants were lower total phosphatidylcholines (PCs), with specifically lower short chain unsaturated PC but higher long chain polyunsaturated PC; higher cholesterol esters; and variable differences in sphingomyelins. At 12 months, lipidomic profiles were markedly different to those at 3 months, and differences between the earlier breast/formula/mixed-feeding groups were no longer evident. However, several specific lipid species, associated with breast-feeding at 3 months, also correlated with differences in 3- to 12-month weight.
CONCLUSIONS: State-of-the-art dried blood spot sample lipidomic profiling demonstrated striking differences between breast-fed and formula-fed infants. Although these changes diminished with age, breast-fed lipidomic profiles at 3 months were associated with infancy weight and could potentially represent biomarkers of infant nutrition.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11306-017-1166-2},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Links between early life exposures and later health outcomes may, in part, be due to nutritional programming in infancy. This hypothesis is supported by observed long-term benefits associated with breastfeeding, such as better cognitive development in childhood, and lower risks of obesity and high blood pressure in later life. However, the possible underlying mechanisms are expected to be complex and may be difficult to disentangle due to the lack of understanding of the metabolic processes that differentiate breastfed infants compared to those receiving just formula feed.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the relationships between infant feeding and the lipid profiles and to validate specific lipids in separate datasets so that a small set of lipids can be used as nutritional biomarkers.
METHOD: We utilized a direct infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry method to analyse the lipid profiles of 3.2 mm dried blood spot samples collected at age 3 months from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-1), which formed the discovery cohort. For validation two sample sets were profiled: Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-2) and Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study (POPS). Lipidomic profiles were compared between infant groups who were either exclusively breastfed, exclusively formula-fed or mixed-fed at various levels. Data analysis included supervised Random Forest method with combined classification and regression mode. Selection of lipids was based on an iterative backward elimination procedure without compromising the class error in the classification mode.
CONCLUSION: From this study, we were able to identify and validate three lipids: PC(35:2), SM(36:2) and SM(39:1) that can be used collectively as biomarkers for infant nutrition during early development. These biomarkers can be used to determine whether young infants (3-6 months) are breast-fed or receive formula milk.},

	abstract = {Background: In this study, we compare methods that can be used to relate a phenotypic trait of interest to an {\textasciitilde}omics data set, where the number or variables outnumbers by far the number of samples. Methods: We apply univariate regression and different regularized multiple regression methods: ridge regression (RR), LASSO, elastic net (EN), principal components regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLS), sparse partial least squares regression (SPLS), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RF). These regression methods were applied to a data set from a potato mapping population, where we predict potato flesh colour from a metabolomics data set. Results: We compare the methods in terms of the mean square error of prediction of the trait, goodness of fit of the models, and the selection and ranking of the metabolites. In terms of the prediction error, elastic net performed better than the other methods. Different numbers of variables are selected by the methods that allow variable selection but seven variables were in common between LASSO, EN and SPLS. SPLS performed better than EN with respect to the selection of grouped correlated variables. Conclusions: Four out of these seven variables selected by LASSO, EN, SPLS were putatively identified as carotenoid derived compounds; since the carotenoid pathway is important for flesh colour of potato, this indicates that meaningful compounds are selected. We developed a web application that can perform all the described methods, and that includes a double cross validation for optimization of the methods and for proper estimation of the prediction error.},

	abstract = {Translational medicine is a domain turning results of basic life science research into new tools and methods in a clinical environment, for example, as new diagnostics or therapies. Nowadays, the process of translation is supported by large amounts of heterogeneous data ranging from medical data to a whole range of -omics data. It is not only a great opportunity but also a great challenge, as translational medicine big data is difficult to integrate and analyze, and requires the involvement of biomedical experts for the data processing. We show here that visualization and interoperable workflows, combining multiple complex steps, can address at least parts of the challenge. In this article, we present an integrated workflow for exploring, analysis, and interpretation of translational medicine data in the context of human health. Three Web services-tranSMART, a Galaxy Server, and a MINERVA platform-are combined into one big data pipeline. Native visualization capabilities enable the biomedical experts to get a comprehensive overview and control over separate steps of the workflow. The capabilities of tranSMART enable a flexible filtering of multidimensional integrated data sets to create subsets suitable for downstream processing. A Galaxy Server offers visually aided construction of analytical pipelines, with the use of existing or custom components. A MINERVA platform supports the exploration of health and disease-related mechanisms in a contextualized analytical visualization system. We demonstrate the utility of our workflow by illustrating its subsequent steps using an existing data set, for which we propose a filtering scheme, an analytical pipeline, and a corresponding visualization of analytical results. The workflow is available as a sandbox environment, where readers can work with the described setup themselves. Overall, our work shows how visualization and interfacing of big data processing services facilitate exploration, analysis, and interpretation of translational medicine data.},

	abstract = {Clinical proteomics has yielded some early positive results-the identification of potential disease biomarkers-indicating the promise for this analytical approach to improve the current state of the art in clinical practice. However, the inability to verify some candidate molecules in subsequent studies has led to skepticism among many clinicians and regulatory bodies, and it has become evident that commonly encountered shortcomings in fundamental aspects of experimental design mainly during biomarker discovery must be addressed in order to provide robust data. In this Perspective, we assert that successful studies generally use suitable statistical approaches for biomarker definition and confirm results in independent test sets; in addition, we describe a brief set of practical and feasible recommendations that we have developed for investigators to properly identify and qualify proteomic biomarkers, which could also be used as reporting requirements. Such recommendations should help put proteomic biomarker discovery on the solid ground needed for turning the old promise into a new reality.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12920-015-0116-y},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the surge of translational medicine and computational omics research, complex disease diagnosis is more and more relying on massive omics data-driven molecular signature detection. However, how to detect and prevent possible diagnostic biases in translational bioinformatics remains an unsolved problem despite its importance in the coming era of personalized medicine.
METHODS: In this study, we comprehensively investigate the diagnostic bias problem by analyzing benchmark gene array, protein array, RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data under the framework of support vector machines for different model selection methods. We further categorize the diagnostic biases into different types by conducting rigorous kernel matrix analysis and provide effective machine learning methods to conquer the diagnostic biases.
RESULTS: In this study, we comprehensively investigate the diagnostic bias problem by analyzing benchmark gene array, protein array, RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data under the framework of support vector machines. We have found that the diagnostic biases happen for data with different distributions and SVM with different kernels. Moreover, we identify total three types of diagnostic biases: overfitting bias, label skewness bias, and underfitting bias in SVM diagnostics, and present corresponding reasons through rigorous analysis. Compared with the overfitting and underfitting biases, the label skewness bias is more challenging to detect and conquer because it can be easily confused as a normal diagnostic case from its deceptive accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose a derivative component analysis based support vector machines to conquer the label skewness bias by achieving the rivaling clinical diagnostic results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that the diagnostic biases are mainly caused by the three major factors, i.e. kernel selection, signal amplification mechanism in high-throughput profiling, and training data label distribution. Moreover, the proposed DCA-SVM diagnosis provides a generic solution for the label skewness bias overcome due to the powerful feature extraction capability from derivative component analysis. Our work identifies and solves an important but less addressed problem in translational research. It also has a positive impact on machine learning for adding new results to kernel-based learning for omics data.},

Here, we review the evidence for these problems in stroke research, where they have been most studied, and in other translational research domains, which seem to be bedevilled by the same issues. We argue that better scientific training and simple changes to the way that we fund, assess and publish research findings could reduce wasted investment, speed drug development, and create a healthier research environment.

	doi = {10.1186/s12943-015-0449-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered responsible for the recurrence and chemoresistance of cancer. Dysregulated autophagy is highly prevalent in many types of cancer including pancreatic cancer and has been implicated in cytoprotection and tumor promotion. This study aimed to investigate the role of autophagy in regulating cancer stemness and chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: The correlation between autophagy and CSCs and its clinical significance were analyzed using pancreatic cancer tissue microarrays. Genetic and pharmacological approaches were applied to explore the function of autophagy on CSC activity and gemcitabine resistance of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: LC3 expression positively correlated with the expression of CSC markers aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), CD44, and CD133 in pancreatic cancer tissues. High coexpression of LC3/ALDH1 was associated with both poor overall survival and progression-free survival. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, higher LC3-II expression was observed in the sphere-forming cells than in the bulk cells. Blockade of autophagy by silencing ATG5, ATG7, and BECN1 or the administration of autophagy inhibitor chloroquine markedly reduced the CSC populations, ALDH1 activity, sphere formation, and resistance to gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, osteopontin (OPN) was found to stimulate LC3-II, ALDH1, CD44, and CD133 expression in PANC-1 cells, whereas this effect could be prevented by OPN knockdown and autophagy blockade. After treatment with various inhibitors against the major signaling pathways downstream of OPN, only the inhibitor of NF-κB activation, BAY 1170-82, could effectively counteract OPN-induced autophagy and CSC activity. According to the histochemical results, pancreatic cancer patients manifesting high levels of OPN/LC3/ALDH1 and OPN/CD44/CD133 had poor survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Induction of autophagy mediated by OPN/NF-κB signaling is required for maintenance of pancreatic CSC activity. Combination of gemcitabine with pharmacological autophagy inhibitors is a promising therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {Activation of cellular stress response pathways to maintain metabolic homeostasis is emerging as a critical growth and survival mechanism in many cancers. The pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) requires high levels of autophagy, a conserved self-degradative process. However, the regulatory circuits that activate autophagy and reprogram PDA cell metabolism are unknown. Here we show that autophagy induction in PDA occurs as part of a broader transcriptional program that coordinates activation of lysosome biogenesis and function, and nutrient scavenging, mediated by the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors. In human PDA cells, the MiT/TFE proteins--MITF, TFE3 and TFEB--are decoupled from regulatory mechanisms that control their cytoplasmic retention. Increased nuclear import in turn drives the expression of a coherent network of genes that induce high levels of lysosomal catabolic function essential for PDA growth. Unbiased global metabolite profiling reveals that MiT/TFE-dependent autophagy-lysosome activation is specifically required to maintain intracellular amino acid pools. These results identify the MiT/TFE proteins as master regulators of metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer and demonstrate that transcriptional activation of clearance pathways converging on the lysosome is a novel hallmark of aggressive malignancy.},

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available1. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of ‘personalized’ therapeutic regimens2.},

Within the Microarray Innovations in LEukemia study, a diagnostic classification model was investigated to distinguish the distinct subclasses of pediatric and adult leukemia, as well as MDS. Overall, the accuracy of the diagnostic classification model for subtyping leukemia was approximately 93\%, but this was not reflected for the MDS samples giving only approximately 50\% accuracy. Discordant samples of MDS were classified either into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or "none-of-the-targets" (neither leukemia nor MDS) categories. To clarify the discordant results, all submitted 174 MDS samples were externally reviewed, although this did not improve the molecular classification results. However, a significant correlation was noted between the AML and "none-of-the-targets" categories and prognosis, leading to a prognostic classification model to predict for time-dependent probability of leukemic transformation. The prognostic classification model accurately discriminated patients with a rapid transformation to AML within 18 months from those with more indolent disease.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are paracrine regulators of the tumor microenvironment and contain complex cargo. We previously reported that exosomes released from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells can suppress residual hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function indirectly through stromal reprogramming of niche retention factors. We found that the systemic loss of hematopoietic function is also in part a consequence of AML exosome-directed microRNA (miRNA) trafficking to HSPCs. Exosomes isolated from cultured AML or the plasma from mice bearing AML xenografts exhibited enrichment of miR-150 and miR-155. HSPCs cocultured with either of these exosomes exhibited impaired clonogenicity, through the miR-150- and miR-155-mediated suppression of the translation of transcripts encoding c-MYB, a transcription factor involved in HSPC differentiation and proliferation. To discover additional miRNA targets, we captured miR-155 and its target transcripts by coimmunoprecipitation with an attenuated RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-trap, followed by high-throughput sequencing. This approach identified known and previously unknown miR-155 target transcripts. Integration of the miR-155 targets with information from the protein interaction database STRING revealed proteins indirectly affected by AML exosome-derived miRNA. Our findings indicate a direct effect of AML exosomes on HSPCs that, through a stroma-independent mechanism, compromises hematopoiesis. Furthermore, combining miRNA target data with protein-protein interaction data may be a broadly applicable strategy to define the effects of exosome-mediated trafficking of regulatory molecules within the tumor microenvironment.},

Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value-a second-generation p-value (pδ)-that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (pδ = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (pδ = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 {\textless} pδ {\textless} 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.},

Among this ecosystem of heterogeneous indicators, social reference managers have been proposed as indicators of broader use of scholarly work. However, little work has been done to understand the data underlying this indicator. The present work uses a large-scale survey to study the users of two prominent social reference managers-Mendeley and Zotero. The survey examines demographic characteristics, usage of the platforms, as well as attitudes towards key issues in scholarly communication, such as open access, peer review, privacy, and the reward system of science. Results show strong differences between platforms: Mendeley users are younger and more gender-balanced; Zotero users are more engaged in social media and more likely to come from the social sciences and humanities. Zotero users are more likely to use the platform's search functions and to organize their libraries, while Mendeley users are more likely to take advantage of some of the discovery and networking features-such as browsing papers and groups and connecting with other users. We discuss the implications of using metrics derived from these platforms as impact indicators.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Although controlled biochemical or biological vocabularies, such as Gene Ontology (GO) (http://www.geneontology.org), address the need for consistent descriptions of genes in different data sources, there is still no effective method to determine the functional similarities of genes based on gene annotation information from heterogeneous data sources.
RESULTS: To address this critical need, we proposed a novel method to encode a GO term's semantics (biological meanings) into a numeric value by aggregating the semantic contributions of their ancestor terms (including this specific term) in the GO graph and, in turn, designed an algorithm to measure the semantic similarity of GO terms. Based on the semantic similarities of GO terms used for gene annotation, we designed a new algorithm to measure the functional similarity of genes. The results of using our algorithm to measure the functional similarities of genes in pathways retrieved from the saccharomyces genome database (SGD), and the outcomes of clustering these genes based on the similarity values obtained by our algorithm are shown to be consistent with human perspectives. Furthermore, we developed a set of online tools for gene similarity measurement and knowledge discovery.

	issn = {1471-2105},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-9-468},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various measures of semantic similarity of terms in bio-ontologies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) have been used to compare gene products. Such measures of similarity have been used to annotate uncharacterized gene products and group gene products into functional groups. There are various ways to measure semantic similarity, either using the topological structure of the ontology, the instances (gene products) associated with terms or a mixture of both. We focus on an instance level definition of semantic similarity while using the information contained in the ontology, both in the graphical structure of the ontology and the semantics of relations between terms, to provide constraints on our instance level description.Semantic similarity of terms is extended to annotations by various approaches, either though aggregation operations such as min, max and average or through an extrapolative method. These approaches introduce assumptions about how semantic similarity of terms relates to the semantic similarity of annotations that do not necessarily reflect how terms relate to each other.
RESULTS: We exploit the semantics of relations in the GO to construct an algorithm called SSA that provides the basis of a framework that naturally extends instance based methods of semantic similarity of terms, such as Resnik's measure, to describing annotations and not just terms. Our measure attempts to correctly interpret how terms combine via their relationships in the ontological hierarchy. SSA uses these relationships to identify the most specific common ancestors between terms. We outline the set of cases in which terms can combine and associate partial order constraints with each case that order the specificity of terms. These cases form the basis for the SSA algorithm. The set of associated constraints also provide a set of principles that any improvement on our method should seek to satisfy.
CONCLUSION: We derive a measure of semantic similarity between annotations that exploits all available information without introducing assumptions about the nature of the ontology or data. We preserve the principles underlying instance based methods of semantic similarity of terms at the annotation level. As a result our measure better describes the information contained in annotations associated with gene products and as a result is better suited to characterizing and classifying gene products through their annotations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Explicit comparisons based on the semantic similarity of Gene Ontology terms provide a quantitative way to measure the functional similarity between gene products and are widely applied in large-scale genomic research via integration with other models. Previously, we presented an edge-based method, Relative Specificity Similarity (RSS), which takes the global position of relevant terms into account. However, edge-based semantic similarity metrics are sensitive to the intrinsic structure of GO and simply consider terms at the same level in the ontology to be equally specific nodes, revealing the weaknesses that could be complemented using information content (IC).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Here, we used the IC-based nodes to improve RSS and proposed a new method, Hybrid Relative Specificity Similarity (HRSS). HRSS outperformed other methods in distinguishing true protein-protein interactions from false. HRSS values were divided into four different levels of confidence for protein interactions. In addition, HRSS was statistically the best at obtaining the highest average functional similarity among human-mouse orthologs. Both HRSS and the groupwise measure, simGIC, are superior in correlation with sequence and Pfam similarities. Because different measures are best suited for different circumstances, we compared two pairwise strategies, the maximum and the best-match average, in the evaluation. The former was more effective at inferring physical protein-protein interactions, and the latter at estimating the functional conservation of orthologs and analyzing the CESSM datasets. In conclusion, HRSS can be applied to different biological problems by quantifying the functional similarity between gene products. The algorithm HRSS was implemented in the C programming language, which is freely available from http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/hrss.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism of eukaryotic gene regulation. Deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a powerful approach for quantitative profiling of AS. With the increasing capacity of high-throughput sequencers, it has become common for RNA-Seq studies of AS to examine multiple biological replicates. We developed rMATS, a new statistical method for robust and flexible detection of differential AS from replicate RNA-Seq data. Besides the analysis of unpaired replicates, rMATS includes a model specifically designed for paired replicates, such as case–control matched pairs in clinical RNA-Seq datasets. We expect rMATS will be useful for genome-wide studies of AS in diverse research projects. Our data also provide new insights about the experimental design for RNA-Seq studies of AS., Ultra-deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We previously developed multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (MATS), a statistical method for detecting differential alternative splicing between two RNA-Seq samples. Here we describe a new statistical model and computer program, replicate MATS (rMATS), designed for detection of differential alternative splicing from replicate RNA-Seq data. rMATS uses a hierarchical model to simultaneously account for sampling uncertainty in individual replicates and variability among replicates. In addition to the analysis of unpaired replicates, rMATS also includes a model specifically designed for paired replicates between sample groups. The hypothesis-testing framework of rMATS is flexible and can assess the statistical significance over any user-defined magnitude of splicing change. The performance of rMATS is evaluated by the analysis of simulated and real RNA-Seq data. rMATS outperformed two existing methods for replicate RNA-Seq data in all simulation settings, and RT-PCR yielded a high validation rate (94\%) in an RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Our data also provide guiding principles for designing RNA-Seq studies of alternative splicing. We demonstrate that it is essential to incorporate biological replicates in the study design. Of note, pooling RNAs or merging RNA-Seq data from multiple replicates is not an effective approach to account for variability, and the result is particularly sensitive to outliers. The rMATS source code is freely available at rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/. As the popularity of RNA-Seq continues to grow, we expect rMATS will be useful for studies of alternative splicing in diverse RNA-Seq projects.},

	abstract = {The cerebellum has a well-established role in controlling motor functions such coordination, balance, posture, and skilled learning. There is mounting evidence that it might also play a critical role in non-motor functions such as cognition and emotion. It is therefore not surprising that cerebellar defects are associated with a wide array of diseases including ataxia, dystonia, tremor, schizophrenia, dyslexia, and autism spectrum disorder. What is intriguing is that a seemingly uniform circuit that is often described as being "simple" should carry out all of these behaviors. Analyses of how cerebellar circuits develop have revealed that such descriptions massively underestimate the complexity of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is in fact highly patterned and organized around a series of parasagittal stripes and transverse zones. This topographic architecture partitions all cerebellar circuits into functional modules that are thought to enhance processing power during cerebellar dependent behaviors. What are arguably the most remarkable features of cerebellar topography are the developmental processes that produce them. This review is concerned with the genetic and cellular mechanisms that orchestrate cerebellar patterning. We place a major focus on how Purkinje cells control multiple aspects of cerebellar circuit assembly. Using this model, we discuss evidence for how "zebra-like" patterns in Purkinje cells sculpt the cerebellum, how specific genetic cues mediate the process, and how activity refines the patterns into an adult map that is capable of executing various functions. We also discuss how defective Purkinje cell patterning might impact the pathogenesis of neurological conditions.},

Each of these behaviors has been found to be impaired in ASD, suggesting that multiple distinct circuits of the cerebellum may be involved in the pathogenesis of patients' sensorimotor impairments. We will review evidence that the development of these circuits is disrupted in individuals with ASD and that their study may help elucidate the pathophysiology of sensorimotor deficits and core symptoms of the disorder. Preclinical studies of monogenetic conditions associated with ASD also have identified selective defects of the cerebellum and documented behavioral rescues when the cerebellum is targeted.

KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).},

	abstract = {Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) display a highly distinctive form of polarity. We have cultured murine PCs from dissociated E16 cerebellar anlagen for 1 week to investigate the early stages of neuronal compartmentalization and synaptic interactions, features which are important for the establishment of neuronal polarity. To unequivocally identify the PCs we utilized light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with an anti-serum to the cell class-specific marker L7/pcp2 gene product. The PCs typically show a single, long axon, numerous short appendages classified as filopodia and protospines, and a small number of protodendrites. The nucleus is positioned asymmetrically in both the horizontal and vertical axes of the soma. The Golgi apparatus, coated and uncoated vesicles, and mitochondria are prominent ultrastructural features, while the endoplasmic reticulum is highly fragmented. The cell body receives rudimentary synapses on its smooth surfaces and appendages and no consistent morphological differences were detected between these elementary contacts. The axon is clearly identifiable; it emanates from either the cell body or a protodendrite, bifurcates at predominantly right angles, forms beaded collaterals, and terminates with relatively large growth cones. The varicosities of the PC axon contain pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and form rudimentary synapses primarily with the dendritic shafts of immunonegative neurons. The protodendrites are short, quickly tapering and sparsely branched; they emit numerous filopodia and immature spines and terminate with small growth cones. Rudimentary synapses are received on the proximal dendritic shafts and filopodia, and more mature synapses occur frequently on protospines. With few exceptions, PCs lie atop an astrocytic bed layer and glial processes are apposed to the various aspects of the PC body left free by the afferent axons. By contrast, PC processes are largely free of glial sheaths. We conclude that the "stellate stage" of PC development in situ is replicated rather faithfully in culture and that PCs have established polarity and have begun to form intercellular contacts by 1 week in vitro. Moreover, the PCs are already morphologically distinct from other cell types in the 1 week cultures, although they have yet to develop the differentiated features that distinguish mature PCs.},

Initially, ITK provided a direct wrapping interface to languages such as Python and Tcl through the WrapITK system. Unlike WrapITK, which exposed ITK's complex templated interface, SimpleITK was designed to provide an easy to use and simplified interface to ITK's algorithms. It includes procedural methods, hides ITK's demand driven pipeline, and provides a template-less layer. Also SimpleITK provides practical conveniences such as binary distribution packages and overloaded operators. Our user-friendly design goals dictated a departure from the direct interface wrapping approach of WrapITK, toward a new facade class structure that only exposes the required functionality, hiding ITK's extensive template use. Internally SimpleITK utilizes a manual description of each filter with code-generation and advanced C++ meta-programming to provide the higher-level interface, bringing the capabilities of ITK to a wider audience.

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

Furthermore, through topographic connections with extensive nonmotor systems, including visceral related nuclei in the brainstem, hypothalamus, as well as the limbic system, FN has also been implicated in regulation of various nonsomatic functions, such as feeding, cardiovascular and respiratory, defecation and micturition, immune, as well as emotional activities. In clinic, FN lesion or dysfunction results in motor deficits including spinocerebellar ataxias, and nonmotor symptoms. In this review, we summarize the cytoarchitecture, anatomic afferent and efferent connections, as well as the motor and nonmotor functions of the FN and the related diseases and disorders. We suggest that by bridging the motor and nonmotor systems, the cerebellar FN may help to integrate somatic motor and nonsomatic functions and consequently contribute to generate a coordinated response to internal and external environments.},

Here we present the first large-scale test of the ortholog conjecture using comparative functional genomic data from human and mouse. We use the experimentally derived functions of more than 8,900 genes, as well as an independent microarray dataset, to directly assess our ability to predict function using both orthologs and paralogs. Both datasets show that paralogs are often a much better predictor of function than are orthologs, even at lower sequence identities. Among paralogs, those found within the same species are consistently more functionally similar than those found in a different species. We also find that paralogous pairs residing on the same chromosome are more functionally similar than those on different chromosomes, perhaps due to higher levels of interlocus gene conversion between these pairs. In addition to offering implications for the computational prediction of protein function, our results shed light on the relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence. We conclude that the most important factor in the evolution of function is not amino acid sequence, but rather the cellular context in which proteins act.},

	abstract = {Background
Several semantic similarity measures have been applied to gene products annotated with Gene Ontology terms, providing a basis for their functional comparison. However, it is still unclear which is the best approach to semantic similarity in this context, since there is no conclusive evaluation of the various measures. Another issue, is whether electronic annotations should or not be used in semantic similarity calculations.

Results
We conducted a systematic evaluation of GO-based semantic similarity measures using the relationship with sequence similarity as a means to quantify their performance, and assessed the influence of electronic annotations by testing the measures in the presence and absence of these annotations. We verified that the relationship between semantic and sequence similarity is not linear, but can be well approximated by a rescaled Normal cumulative distribution function. Given that the majority of the semantic similarity measures capture an identical behaviour, but differ in resolution, we used the latter as the main criterion of evaluation.

Conclusions
This work has provided a basis for the comparison of several semantic similarity measures, and can aid researchers in choosing the most adequate measure for their work. We have found that the hybrid simGIC was the measure with the best overall performance, followed by Resnik's measure using a best-match average combination approach. We have also found that the average and maximum combination approaches are problematic since both are inherently influenced by the number of terms being combined. We suspect that there may be a direct influence of data circularity in the behaviour of the results including electronic annotations, as a result of functional inference from sequence similarity.},

Growing evidence in recent studies suggests that cancer can be better understood through mutated or dysregulated pathways or networks rather than individual mutations and that the efficacy of repositioned drugs can be inferred from disease modules in molecular networks. This article reviews network-based machine learning and graph theory algorithms for integrative analysis of personal genomic data and biomedical knowledge bases to identify tumor-specific molecular mechanisms, candidate targets and repositioned drugs for personalized treatment. The review focuses on the algorithmic design and mathematical formulation of these methods to facilitate applications and implementations of network-based analysis in the practice of precision oncology. We review the methods applied in three scenarios to integrate genomic data and network models in different analysis pipelines, and we examine three categories of network-based approaches for repositioning drugs in drug–disease–gene networks. In addition, we perform a comprehensive subnetwork/pathway analysis of mutations in 31 cancer genome projects in the Cancer Genome Atlas and present a detailed case study on ovarian cancer.

This article briefly reviews the use of microarrays in the brain-behavior context and then illustrates why RNA-Seq is a superior strategy. Compared with microarrays, RNA-Seq has a greater dynamic range, detects both coding and noncoding RNAs, is superior for gene network construction, detects alternative spliced transcripts, detects allele specific expression and can be used to extract genotype information, e.g. nonsynonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms. Examples of where RNA-Seq has been used to assess brain gene expression are provided. Despite the advantages of RNA-Seq, some disadvantages remain. These include the high cost of RNA-Seq and the computational complexities associated with data analysis. RNA-Seq embraces the complexity of the transcriptome and provides a mechanism to understand the underlying regulatory code; the potential to inform the brain-behavior relationship is substantial.},

It consists of the vermis and two hemispheres and is anatomically separated into ten lobules that are designated as I–X. Although neuroimaging and clinical studies suggest that functions are compartmentalized within the cerebellum, the function of each cerebellar lobule is not fully understood. Electrophysiological and lesion studies in animals as well as neuroimaging and lesion studies in humans have revealed that vermian lobules VI and VII (declive, folium, and tuber) are critical for controlling postural balance, saccadic eye movements, and coordination. In addition, recent structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed that these lobules are larger in elite basketball and short-track speed skaters. Furthermore, in female short-track speed skaters, the volume of this region is significantly correlated with static balance. This article reviews the function of vermian lobules VI and VII, focusing on the control of balance, eye movements, and coordination including coordination between the eyes and hands and bimanual coordination.},

	abstract = {Gene networks are commonly interpreted as encoding functional information in their connections. An extensively validated principle called guilt by association states that genes which are associated or interacting are more likely to share function. Guilt by association provides the central top-down principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in encoding functional information. In this work, we show that functional information within gene networks is typically concentrated in only a very few interactions whose properties cannot be reliably related to the rest of the network. In effect, the apparent encoding of function within networks has been largely driven by outliers whose behaviour cannot even be generalized to individual genes, let alone to the network at large. While experimentalist-driven analysis of interactions may use prior expert knowledge to focus on the small fraction of critically important data, large-scale computational analyses have typically assumed that high-performance cross-validation in a network is due to a generalizable encoding of function. Because we find that gene function is not systemically encoded in networks, but dependent on specific and critical interactions, we conclude it is necessary to focus on the details of how networks encode function and what information computational analyses use to extract functional meaning. We explore a number of consequences of this and find that network structure itself provides clues as to which connections are critical and that systemic properties, such as scale-free-like behaviour, do not map onto the functional connectivity within networks.},

	abstract = {Backgound: The inability to detect premature atherosclerosis significantly hinders implementation of personalized therapy to prevent coronary heart disease. A comprehensive understanding of arterial protein networks and how they change in early atherosclerosis could identify new biomarkers for disease detection and improved therapeutic targets.
Methods: Here we describe the human arterial proteome and proteomic features strongly associated with early atherosclerosis based on mass spectrometry analysis of coronary artery and aortic specimens from 100 autopsied young adults (200 arterial specimens). Convex analysis of mixtures, differential dependent network modeling, and bioinformatic analyses defined the composition, network rewiring, and likely regulatory features of the protein networks associated with early atherosclerosis and how they vary across 2 anatomic distributions.
Results: The data document significant differences in mitochondrial protein abundance between coronary and aortic samples (coronary{\textgreater}{\textgreater}aortic), and between atherosclerotic and normal tissues (atherosclerotic{\textless}{\textless}normal), and major alterations in tumor necrosis factor, insulin receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ protein networks, as well, in the setting of early disease. In addition, a subset of tissue protein biomarkers indicative of early atherosclerosis was shown to predict anatomically defined coronary atherosclerosis when measured in plasma samples in a separate clinical cohort (area under the curve=0.92 [0.83–0.96]), thereby validating the use of human tissue proteomics to discover relevant plasma biomarkers for clinical applications. In addition to the specific proteins and pathways identified here, the publicly available data resource and the analysis pipeline used illustrate a strategy for interrogating and interpreting the proteomic architecture of tissues that may be relevant for other chronic diseases characterized by multicellular tissue phenotypes.
Conclusions: The human arterial proteome can be viewed as a complex network whose architectural features vary considerably as a function of anatomic location and the presence or absence of atherosclerosis. The data suggest important reductions in mitochondrial protein abundance in early atherosclerosis and also identify a subset of plasma proteins that are highly predictive of angiographically defined coronary disease.},

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular deep learning architecture widely applied in different domains, in particular in classifying over images, for which the concept of convolution with a filter comes naturally. Unfortunately, the requirement of a distance (or, at least, of a neighbourhood function) in the input feature space has so far prevented its direct use on data types such as omics data. However, a number of omics data are metrizable, i.e., they can be endowed with a metric structure, enabling to adopt a convolutional based deep learning framework, e.g., for prediction. We propose a generalized solution for CNNs on omics data, implemented through a dedicated Keras layer. In particular, for metagenomics data, a metric can be derived from the patristic distance on the phylogenetic tree. For transcriptomics data, we combine Gene Ontology semantic similarity and gene co-expression to define a distance; the function is defined through a multilayer network where 3 layers are defined by the GO mutual semantic similarity while the fourth one by gene co-expression. As a general tool, feature distance on omics data is enabled by OmicsConv, a novel Keras layer, obtaining OmicsCNN, a dedicated deep learning framework. Here we demonstrate OmicsCNN on gut microbiota sequencing data, for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 16S data, first on synthetic data and then a metagenomics collection of gut microbiota of 222 IBD patients.},

Results: A software pipeline, Flexible Algorithm for Novel Gene set Simulation (FANGS) develops simulated data based on a prostate cancer dataset where the KRAS and TGF-β pathways were differentially expressed. The FANGS software is compatible with other datasets and pathways. Comparisons of gene set analysis methods are presented for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Significance Analysis of Function and Expression (SAFE), sigPathway, and Correlation Adjusted Mean RAnk (CAMERA) methods. All gene set analysis methods are tested using gene sets from the MSigDB knowledge base. The false positive rate and power are estimated and presented for comparison. Recommendations are made for the utility of the default settings of methods and each method's sensitivity towards various effect sizes.
Conclusions: The results of this study provide empirical guidance to users of gene set analysis methods. The FANGS software is available for researchers for continued methods comparisons.},

In this paper, we describe a non-linear embedding technique called Barnes-Hut Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-SNE) that emphasizes the local similarity structure of high-dimensional data points. By applying BH-SNE to the gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlases, we demonstrate the consistency of the 2D, non-linear embedding of the sagittal and coronal mouse brain atlases, and across 6 human brains. In addition, we quantitatively show that BH-SNE maps are superior in their separation of neuroanatomical regions in comparison to PCA and cMDS. Finally, we assess the effect of higher-order principal components on the global structure of the BH-SNE similarity maps. Based on our observations, we conclude that BH-SNE maps with or without prior dimensionality reduction (based on PCA) provide comprehensive and intuitive insights in both the local and global spatial transcriptome structure of the human and mouse Allen Brain Atlases.},

	abstract = {Background
Phenotypic heterogeneity in autism has long been conjectured to be a
major hindrance to the discovery of genetic risk factors, leading to
numerous attempts to stratify children based on phenotype to increase power
of discovery studies. This approach, however, is based on the hypothesis
that phenotypic heterogeneity closely maps to genetic variation, which has
not been tested. Our study examines the impact of sub-phenotyping of a
well-characterized ASD sample on genetic homogeneity and the ability to
discover common genetic variants conferring liability to ASD.

Methods
Genome-wide genotypic data of 2576 families from the Simons Simplex
Collection (SSC) were analyzed in the overall sample and phenotypic
subgroups defined on the basis of diagnosis, IQ, and symptom profiles. We
conducted a family-based association study as well as estimating
heritability and evaluating allele scores for each phenotypic subgroup.

Results
Association analyses revealed no genome-wide significant association
signal. Sub-phenotyping did not increase power substantially. Moreover,
allele scores built from the most associated SNPs, based on the odds ratio
in the full sample, predicted case status in subsets of the sample equally
well and heritability estimates were very similar for all subgroups.

Conclusions
In genome-wide association analysis of the SSC sample, reducing
phenotypic heterogeneity had at most a modest impact on genetic homogeneity.
Our results are based on a relatively small sample, one with greater
homogeneity than the entire population; if they apply more broadly, they
imply that analysis of sub-phenotypes is not a productive path forward for
discovering genetic risk variants in ASD.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with strong evidence for genetic susceptibility. However, the effect sizes for implicated chromosomal loci are small, hard to replicate and current evidence does not explain the majority of the estimated heritability. Phenotypic heterogeneity could be one phenomenon complicating identification of genetic factors. We used data from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, head circumferences, and ages at exams as classifying variables to identify more clinically similar subgroups of individuals with ASD. We identified two distinct subgroups of cases within the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange dataset, primarily defined by the overall severity of evaluated traits. In addition, there was significant familial clustering within subgroups (odds ratio, OR ≈ 1.38-1.42, P {\textless} 0.00001), and genotypes were more similar within subgroups compared to the unsubgrouped dataset (Fst = 0.17 ± 0.0.0009). These results suggest that the subgroups recapitulate genetic etiology. Using the same approach in an independent dataset from the Autism Genome Project, we similarly identified two distinct subgroups of cases and confirmed this severity-based dichotomy. We also observed evidence for genetic contributions to subgroups identified in the replication dataset. Our results provide more effective methods of phenotype definition that should increase power to detect genetic factors influencing risk for ASD.},

	abstract = {Background
Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) {\textless}1.15).

Methods
We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls).

Results
We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes including PITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation and CUEDC2 previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0.23; P = 9 × 10−6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such as FOXP1 at 3p13, ATP2B2 at 3p25.3, and a ‘neurodevelopmental hub’ on chromosome 8p11.23.

Conclusions
This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such as EXT1, ASTN2, MACROD2, and HDAC4.

A subset of modules overlapped with RNA co-expression networks, including those associated with neurons and astroglial cell types, showing altered expression in AD, even in the asymptomatic stages. Overlap of RNA and protein networks was otherwise modest, with many modules specific to the proteome, including those linked to microtubule function and inflammation. Proteomic modules were validated in an independent cohort, demonstrating some module expression changes unique to AD and several observed in other neurodegenerative diseases. AD genetic risk loci were concentrated in glial-related modules in the proteome and transcriptome, consistent with their causal role in AD.

However, the analysis of gene coexpression patterns is often treated as a mechanistic black box, in which looming “hub genes” direct cellular networks, and where other features are obscured. By examining the biophysical bases of coexpression and gene regulatory changes that occur in disease, recent studies suggest it is possible to use coexpression networks as a multi-omic screening procedure to generate novel hypotheses for disease mechanisms. Because technical processing steps can affect the outcome and interpretation of coexpression networks, we examine the assumptions and alternatives to common patterns of coexpression analysis and discuss additional topics such as acceptable datasets for coexpression analysis, the robust identification of modules, disease-related prioritization of genes and molecular systems and network meta-analysis. To accelerate coexpression research beyond modules and hubs, we highlight some emerging directions for coexpression network research that are especially relevant to complex brain disease, including the centrality-lethality relationship, integration with machine learning approaches and network pharmacology.},

Studies comparing transcription in human and mouse have come to varied conclusions, in part because of their relatively small sample sizes or underpowered methodologies. To better characterize gene expression differences between mouse and human, we took a systems-biology approach by using weighted gene coexpression network analysis on more than 1,000 microarrays from brain. We find that global network properties of the brain transcriptome are highly preserved between species. Furthermore, all modules of highly coexpressed genes identified in mouse were identified in human, with those related to conserved cellular functions showing the strongest between-species preservation. Modules corresponding to glial and neuronal cells were sufficiently preserved between mouse and human to permit identification of cross species cell-class marker genes. We also identify several robust human-specific modules, including one strongly correlated with measures of Alzheimer disease progression across multiple data sets, whose hubs are poorly-characterized genes likely involved in Alzheimer disease. We present multiple lines of evidence suggesting links between neurodegenerative disease and glial cell types in human, including human-specific correlation of presenilin-1 with oligodendrocyte markers, and significant enrichment for known neurodegenerative disease genes in microglial modules. Together, this work identifies convergent and divergent pathways in mouse and human, and provides a systematic framework that will be useful for understanding the applicability of mouse models for human brain disorders.},

The considered algorithms are able to deal with continuous time-to-event survival data. Feature selection and model building were performed on a multicentre cohort (213 patients) and validated using an independent cohort (80 patients). We found several combinations of machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods which achieve similar results, e.g., MSR-RF: C-Index = 0.71 and BT-COX: C-Index = 0.70 in combination with Spearman feature selection. Using the best performing models, patients were stratified into groups of low and high risk of recurrence. Significant differences in LRC were obtained between both groups on the validation cohort.

The availability of existing large collections of linkage data paved the way for the use of family-based GWAS. Although most published GWAS used population-based designs, family-based designs have played an important role, particularly in replication stages. Family-based designs offer advantages in terms of quality control, the robustness to population stratification and the ability to perform genetic analyses that cannot be achieved using a sample of unrelated individuals, such as testing for the effect of imprinted genes on phenotypes, testing whether a genetic variant is inherited or de novo and combined linkage and association analysis.},

	abstract = {Approaches based on linear mixed models (LMMs) have recently gained popularity for modelling population substructure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies. In the last few years, a bewildering variety of different LMM methods/software packages have been developed, but it is not always clear how (or indeed whether) any newly-proposed method differs from previously-proposed implementations. Here we compare the performance of several LMM approaches (and software implementations, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA and MMM) via their application to a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families comprising 3626 individuals (1972 genotyped). The implementations differ in precise details of methodology implemented and through various user-chosen options such as the method and number of SNPs used to estimate the kinship (relatedness) matrix. We investigate sensitivity to these choices and the success (or otherwise) of the approaches in controlling the overall genome-wide error-rate for both real and simulated phenotypes. We compare the LMM results to those obtained using traditional family-based association tests (based on transmission of alleles within pedigrees) and to alternative approaches implemented in the software packages MQLS, ROADTRIPS and MASTOR. We find strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches, and all are successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate (except for some approaches when applied naively to longitudinal data with many repeated measures). We also find high correlation between LMMs and alternative approaches (apart from transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects). We conclude that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches. Given their strong concordance, in most applications, the choice of precise LMM implementation cannot be based on power/type I error considerations but must instead be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use.},

To understand OA better researchers have often used animal models to represent this disease; however, these models have never been fully-evaluated against human cartilage. This study considered the messages produced by cartilage cells in both humans and rats. Using a method that creates a network of messages the study was able to define “blocks” of cell messages that were associated with diseased cartilage in both the rat and human. As part of this study the authors also defined a set of messages that could be used to distinguish healthy and disease cartilage. In this way it may be possible to define patients with early OA that may benefit from therapeutic interventions. (135)},

While great efforts have been put into understanding the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the etiology of the disease, the exact molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. T1D is a heterogeneous disease, and previous research in this field is mainly focused on the analysis of single genes, or using traditional gene expression profiling, which generally does not reveal the functional context of a gene associated with a complex disorder. However, network-based analysis does take into account the interactions between the diabetes specific genes or proteins and contributes to new knowledge about disease modules, which in turn can be used for identification of potential new biomarkers for T1D. In this study, we analyzed public microarray data of T1D patients and healthy controls by applying a systems biology approach that combines network-based Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) with functional enrichment analysis. Novel co-expression gene network modules associated with T1D were elucidated, which in turn provided a basis for the identification of potential pathways and biomarker genes that may be involved in development of T1D.},

The second part provides a repository of public, user-friendly tools for network construction, visualisation and analysis. Two different and complementary approaches of network analysis are presented: the topological approach studies the network as a whole by means of structural graph theory, whereas the global approach divides the PPIN into sub-graphs, or modules. In section three, some concepts and tools regarding heterogeneous molecular data integration through a PPIN are described. Finally, the fourth part is an example of how to extract meaningful biological information from a colorectal cancer PPIN using some of the described tools.},

Software tools can enhance our ability to explore network visualizations and improve our understanding of biological systems, particularly when these tools offer analysis capabilities. However, most published network visualizations are static representations that do not support user interaction.
RESULTS: JNets was designed as a network visualization tool that incorporates annotation to explore the underlying features of interaction networks. The software is available as an application and a configurable applet that can provide a flexible and dynamic online interface to many types of network data. As a case study, we use JNets to investigate approved drug targets present within the HIV-1 Human protein interaction network. Our software highlights the intricate influence that HIV-1 has on the host immune response.
CONCLUSION: JNets is a software tool that allows interaction networks to be visualized and studied remotely, from within a standard web page. Therefore, using this free software, network data can be presented in an enhanced, interactive format. More information about JNets is available at http://www.manchester.ac.uk/bioinformatics/jnets.},

The enhancements comprise a set of brain choropleths and the ability to display these as stacked slices, accessible with a slider. For the first time, this allows the neuroimaging community to take advantage of the advanced tools already available for exploring geographic data. Our brain choropleths are modeled after widely used geographic maps but this mashup of brain choropleths with extant visualization software fills an important neuroinformatic niche. To date, most neuroinformatic tools have provided online databases and atlases of the brain, but not good ways to display the related data (e.g., behavioral, genetic, medical, etc). The extension of the choropleth to brain maps allows us to leverage general-purpose visualization tools for concurrent exploration of brain images and related data. Related data can be represented as a variety of tables, charts and graphs that are dynamically linked to each other and to the brain choropleths. We demonstrate that the simplified region-based analyses that underlay choropleths can provide insights into neuroimaging data comparable to those achieved by using more conventional methods. In addition, the interactive interface facilitates additional insights by allowing the user to filter, compare, and drill down into the visual representations of the data. This enhanced data visualization capability is useful during the initial phases of data analysis and the resulting visualizations provide a compelling way to publish data as an online supplement to journal articles.},

One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

Methodology In this paper we present three objective methods to define hub proteins in PINs: one is a purely topological method and two others are based on gene expression and function. By applying these methods to four distinct PINs, we examine the extent of agreement among these methods and implications of these results on network construction. Conclusions We find that the methods agree well for networks that contain a balance between error-free and unbiased interactions, indicating that the hub concept is meaningful for such networks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A computationally efficient tool is required for a genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis that tests an extremely large number of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interaction pairs in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Current tools for GWAS interaction analysis are mainly developed for unrelated case-control samples. Relatively fewer tools for interaction analysis are available for complex disease studies with family-based design, and these tools tend to be computationally expensive.
RESULTS: We developed a fast gene-gene interaction test, GCORE-sib, for discordant sib pairs and implemented the test into an efficient tool. We used simulations to demonstrate that the GCORE-sib has correct type I error rates and has comparable power to that of the regression-based interaction test. We also showed that the GCORE-sib can run more than 10 times faster than the regression-based test. Finally, the GCORE-sib was applied to a GWAS dataset with approximately 2,000 discordant sib pairs, and the GCORE-sib finished testing 19,368,078,382 pairs of SNPs within 6 days.
CONCLUSIONS: An efficient gene-gene interaction tool for discordant sib pairs was developed. It will be very useful for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis in GWAS using discordant sib pairs. The tool can be downloaded for free at http://gcore-sib.sourceforge.net .},

	abstract = {With millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified and characterized, genomewide association studies have begun to identify susceptibility genes for complex traits and diseases. These studies involve the characterization and analysis of very-high-resolution SNP genotype data for hundreds or thousands of individuals. We describe a computationally efficient approach to testing association between SNPs and quantitative phenotypes, which can be applied to whole-genome association scans. In addition to observed genotypes, our approach allows estimation of missing genotypes, resulting in substantial increases in power when genotyping resources are limited. We estimate missing genotypes probabilistically using the Lander-Green or Elston-Stewart algorithms and combine high-resolution SNP genotypes for a subset of individuals in each pedigree with sparser marker data for the remaining individuals. We show that power is increased whenever phenotype information for ungenotyped individuals is included in analyses and that high-density genotyping of just three carefully selected individuals in a nuclear family can recover {\textgreater}90\% of the information available if every individual were genotyped, for a fraction of the cost and experimental effort. To aid in study design, we evaluate the power of strategies that genotype different subsets of individuals in each pedigree and make recommendations about which individuals should be genotyped at a high density. To illustrate our method, we performed genomewide association analysis for 27 gene-expression phenotypes in 3-generation families (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain pedigrees), in which genotypes for ∼860,000 SNPs in 90 grandparents and parents are complemented by genotypes for ∼6,700 SNPs in a total of 168 individuals. In addition to increasing the evidence of association at 15 previously identified cis-acting associated alleles, our genotype-inference algorithm allowed us to identify associated alleles at 4 cis-acting loci that were missed when analysis was restricted to individuals with the high-density SNP data. Our genotype-inference algorithm and the proposed association tests are implemented in software that is available for free.},

	abstract = {With millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified and characterized, genomewide association studies have begun to identify susceptibility genes for complex traits and diseases. These studies involve the characterization and analysis of very-high-resolution SNP genotype data for hundreds or thousands of individuals. We describe a computationally efficient approach to testing association between SNPs and quantitative phenotypes, which can be applied to whole-genome association scans. In addition to observed genotypes, our approach allows estimation of missing genotypes, resulting in substantial increases in power when genotyping resources are limited. We estimate missing genotypes probabilistically using the Lander-Green or Elston-Stewart algorithms and combine high-resolution SNP genotypes for a subset of individuals in each pedigree with sparser marker data for the remaining individuals. We show that power is increased whenever phenotype information for ungenotyped individuals is included in analyses and that high-density genotyping of just three carefully selected individuals in a nuclear family can recover {\textgreater}90\% of the information available if every individual were genotyped, for a fraction of the cost and experimental effort. To aid in study design, we evaluate the power of strategies that genotype different subsets of individuals in each pedigree and make recommendations about which individuals should be genotyped at a high density. To illustrate our method, we performed genomewide association analysis for 27 gene-expression phenotypes in 3-generation families (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain pedigrees), in which genotypes for ∼860,000 SNPs in 90 grandparents and parents are complemented by genotypes for ∼6,700 SNPs in a total of 168 individuals. In addition to increasing the evidence of association at 15 previously identified cis-acting associated alleles, our genotype-inference algorithm allowed us to identify associated alleles at 4 cis-acting loci that were missed when analysis was restricted to individuals with the high-density SNP data. Our genotype-inference algorithm and the proposed association tests are implemented in software that is available for free.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explore the relationship between genome variability and disease susceptibility with either population- or family-based data. Here, we have evaluated the utility of combining population- and family-based statistical association tests and have proposed a method for reducing the burden of multiple testing. Unrelated singleton and parent-offspring trio cases and controls from the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) study were analyzed for genetic association with diabetic nephropathy (DN) in type 1 diabetics (T1D). The Cochran-Armitage test for trend and the family-based association test were employed using either unrelated cases and controls or trios, respectively. In addition to combining single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) p-values across these tests via Fisher's method, we employed a novel screening approach to rank SNPs based on conditional power for more efficient testing. Using either the population-based or family-based subset alone predictably limited resolution to detect DN SNPs. For 384,197 SNPs passing quality control (QC), none achieved strict genome-wide significance (1.4 × 10(-7)) using 1171 singletons (577/594 cases/controls) or 1738 pooled singletons and offspring probands (841/897). Similarly, none of the 352,004 SNPs passing QC in 567 family trios (264/303 case/control proband trios) reached genome-wide significance. Testing the top 10 SNPs ranked using aggregated conditional power resulted in two SNPs reaching genome-wide significance, rs11645147 on chromosome 16 (p = 1.74 × 10(-4) {\textless} 0.05/10 = 0.005) and rs7866522 on chromosome 9 (p = 0.0033). Efficient usage of mixed designs incorporating both unrelated and family-based data may help to uncover associations otherwise difficult to detect in the presence of massive multiple testing corrections. Capitalizing on the strengths of both types while using screening approaches may be useful especially in light of large-scale, next-generation sequencing and rare variant studies.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Several efficient gene-gene interaction tests have been developed for unrelated case-control samples in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), making it possible to test tens of billions of interaction pairs of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a reasonable timeframe. However, current family-based gene-gene interaction tests are computationally expensive and are not applicable to genome-wide interaction analysis.
RESULTS: We developed an efficient family-based gene-gene interaction test, GCORE, for trios (i.e. two parents and one affected sib). The GCORE compares interlocus correlations at two SNPs between the transmitted and non-transmitted alleles. We used simulation studies to compare the statistical properties such as type I error rates and power for the GCORE with several other family-based interaction tests under various scenarios. We applied the GCORE to a family-based GWAS for autism consisting of approximately 2000 trios. Testing a total of 22 471 383 013 interaction pairs in the GWAS can be finished in 36 h by the GCORE without large-scale computing resources, demonstrating that the test is practical for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis in trios.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GCORE is implemented with C ++ and is available at http://gscore.sourceforge.net

	abstract = {Background
Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) {\textless}1.15).

Methods
We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls).

Results
We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes including PITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation and CUEDC2 previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0.23; P = 9 × 10−6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such as FOXP1 at 3p13, ATP2B2 at 3p25.3, and a ‘neurodevelopmental hub’ on chromosome 8p11.23.

Conclusions
This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such as EXT1, ASTN2, MACROD2, and HDAC4.

	abstract = {Background
Phenotypic heterogeneity in autism has long been conjectured to be a
major hindrance to the discovery of genetic risk factors, leading to
numerous attempts to stratify children based on phenotype to increase power
of discovery studies. This approach, however, is based on the hypothesis
that phenotypic heterogeneity closely maps to genetic variation, which has
not been tested. Our study examines the impact of sub-phenotyping of a
well-characterized ASD sample on genetic homogeneity and the ability to
discover common genetic variants conferring liability to ASD.

Methods
Genome-wide genotypic data of 2576 families from the Simons Simplex
Collection (SSC) were analyzed in the overall sample and phenotypic
subgroups defined on the basis of diagnosis, IQ, and symptom profiles. We
conducted a family-based association study as well as estimating
heritability and evaluating allele scores for each phenotypic subgroup.

Results
Association analyses revealed no genome-wide significant association
signal. Sub-phenotyping did not increase power substantially. Moreover,
allele scores built from the most associated SNPs, based on the odds ratio
in the full sample, predicted case status in subsets of the sample equally
well and heritability estimates were very similar for all subgroups.

Conclusions
In genome-wide association analysis of the SSC sample, reducing
phenotypic heterogeneity had at most a modest impact on genetic homogeneity.
Our results are based on a relatively small sample, one with greater
homogeneity than the entire population; if they apply more broadly, they
imply that analysis of sub-phenotypes is not a productive path forward for
discovering genetic risk variants in ASD.},

	abstract = {We employed quantitative autoradiography to examine the distribution of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors in the rat CNS. The binding of [3H]3-methyl-histidine-TRH [( 3H]MeTRH) to TRH receptors in frozen rat brain sections was saturable, of a high affinity (Kd = 5 nM), and specific for TRH analogs. Autoradiograms of [3H]MeTRH binding showed highest concentrations of TRH receptors in the rhinencephalon, including accessory olfactory bulb, nuclei of the amygdala, and the ventral dentate gyrus and subiculum of the hippocampus. Moderate TRH receptor concentrations were found within the thalamus and hypothalamus, in most regions of the rhombencephalon, such as the cranial nerve nuclei, and in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. Neocortex and basal ganglia contained low densities of TRH receptors. This distribution correlates well with the sensitivity of brain regions to the known effects of TRH, and suggests that TRH receptors may mediate the actions of TRH in the rat CNS.},

Here, we provide evidence that CLOCK-Interacting Protein, Circadian (CIPC) is an additional negative-feedback regulator of the circadian clock. CIPC exhibits circadian regulation in multiple tissues, and it is a potent and specific inhibitor of CLOCK–BMAL1 activity that functions independently of CRYs. CIPC–CLOCK protein complexes are present in vivo, and depletion of endogenous CIPC shortens the circadian period length. CIPC is unrelated to known proteins and has no recognizable homologues outside vertebrates. Our results suggest that negative feedback in the mammalian circadian clock is divided into distinct pathways, and that the addition of new genes has contributed to the complexity of vertebrate clocks.},

	abstract = {Context: Sleep abnormalities are associated with low bone mineral density. Underlying mechanisms are unknown.
Objective: Investigate the impact of sleep restriction with circadian disruption on bone biomarkers.
Design: Intervention study.
Participants and Methods: Four bone biomarkers [C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) = bone resorption, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) = bone formation, sclerostin and fibroblast growth factor 23 = osteocyte function] were measured in bihourly serum samples over 24 hours at baseline and after ∼3 weeks of sleep restriction (5.6 hours sleep/24 hours) with concurrent circadian disruption (recurring 28-hour "day" in dim light) in 10 men (age groups: 20 to 27 years, n = 6; 55 to 65 years, n = 4). The effects of sleep/circadian disruption and age on bone biomarker levels were evaluated using maximum likelihood estimation in a mixed model for repeated measures.
Results: P1NP levels were lower after intervention compared with baseline (P {\textless} 0.001); the decrease in P1NP was greater for younger compared with older men (28.0\% vs 18.2\%, P {\textless} 0.001). There was no change in CTX (Δ = 0.03 ± 0.02 ng/mL, P = 0.10). Sclerostin levels were higher postintervention in the younger men only (Δ = 22.9\% or 5.64 ± 1.10 pmol/L, P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: These data suggest that 3 weeks of circadian disruption with concurrent sleep restriction can lead to an uncoupling of bone turnover wherein bone formation is decreased but bone resorption is unchanged. Circadian disruption and sleep restriction may be most detrimental to bone in early adulthood.},

	abstract = {The main mammalian circadian pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (BB(2)) are synthesized by rodent SCN neurons, but the role of GRP in circadian rhythm processes is unknown. In this study, we examined the phase-resetting actions of GRP on the electrical activity rhythms of hamster and rat SCN neurons in vitro. In both rat and hamster SCN slices, GRP treatment during the day did not alter the time of peak SCN firing. In contrast, GRP application early in the subjective night phase-delayed, whereas similar treatment later in the subjective night phase-advanced the firing rate rhythm in rat and hamster SCN slices. These phase shifts were completely blocked by the selective BB(2) receptor antagonist, [d-Phe(6), Des-Met(14)]-bombesin 6-14 ethylamide. We also investigated the temporal changes in the expression of genes for the BB(1) and BB(2) receptors in the rat SCN using a quantitative competitive RT-PCR protocol. The expression of the genes for both receptors was easily detected, but their expression did not vary over the diurnal cycle. These data show that GRP phase-dependently phase resets the rodent SCN circadian pacemaker in vitro apparently via the BB(2) receptor. Because this pattern of phase shifting resembles that of light on rodent behavioral rhythms, these results support the contention that GRP participates in the photic entrainment of the rodent SCN circadian pacemaker.},

Pharmacological application of GRP in vivo or in vitro can shift the phase of circadian rhythms, and GRPr-deficient mice show blunted photic phase shifting. Given the in vivo and in vitro effects of GRP on circadian behavior and on SCN neuronal activity, we investigated whether the GRPr might be under circadian and/or diurnal control. Using in situ hybridization and autoradiographic receptor binding, we localized the GRPr in the mouse SCN and determined that GRP binding varies with time of day in animals housed in a light-dark cycle but not in conditions of constant darkness. The latter results were confirmed with Western blots of SCN tissue. Together, the present findings reveal that changes in GRPr are light driven and not endogenously organized. Diurnal variation in GRPr activity probably underlies intra-SCN signaling important for entrainment and phase shifting.},

Although core components of circadian clocks in flies and mammals are transcriptional circuits, recent evidence indicates posttranscriptional regulation of the clock occurs. Studies from Lim and Allada (p. 875) and Zhang et al. (p. 879) converge to show that the protein ATAXIN-2, associated with neurodegenerative diseases in humans, is a regulator of translation required for normal clock function in pacemaker neurons and for daily rhythms of behavior. ATAXIN is an RNA-binding protein and cooperates in the accumulation of the Per (Period) protein, a core transcriptional regulatory component of the clock.
Evidence for transcriptional feedback in circadian timekeeping is abundant, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying translational control. We found that ATAXIN-2 (ATX2), an RNA-associated protein involved in neurodegenerative disease, is a translational activator of the rate-limiting clock component PERIOD (PER) in Drosophila. ATX2 specifically interacted with TWENTY-FOUR (TYF), an activator of PER translation. RNA interference–mediated depletion of Atx2 or the expression of a mutant ATX2 protein that does not associate with polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP) suppressed behavioral rhythms and decreased abundance of PER. Although ATX2 can repress translation, depletion of Atx2 from Drosophila S2 cells inhibited translational activation by RNA-tethered TYF and disrupted the association between TYF and PABP. Thus, ATX2 coordinates an active translation complex important for PER expression and circadian rhythms.
Fruit fly circadian clock function requires protein translation regulated by an RNA-binding protein.

Here we screened 103 embryonic lethal and sub-viable mouse knockout lines from the Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders program for placental phenotypes. We found that 68\% of knockout lines that are lethal at or after mid-gestation exhibited placental dysmorphologies. Early lethality (embryonic days 9.5–14.5) is almost always associated with severe placental malformations. Placental defects correlate strongly with abnormal brain, heart and vascular development. Analysis of mutant trophoblast stem cells and conditional knockouts suggests that a considerable number of factors that cause embryonic lethality when ablated have primary gene function in trophoblast cells. Our data highlight the hugely under-appreciated importance of placental defects in contributing to abnormal embryo development and suggest key molecular nodes that govern placenta formation.},

Indeed, recent studies demonstrate time-of-day impact on therapeutic outcomes in human heart disease and cancer. Yet biological time is rarely given clinical consideration. A key barrier is the absence of information on the what and where of molecular rhythms in the human body. Here, we have applied CYCLOPS, an algorithm designed to reconstruct sample order in the absence of time-of-day information, to the GTEx collection of 632 human donors contributing 4,292 RNA-seq samples from 13 distinct human tissue types. We identify rhythms in expression across the body that persist at the population-level. This includes a set of ubiquitous cyclers comprised of well-established circadian clock factors but also many genes without prior circadian context. Among thousands of tissue-divergent rhythms, we discover a set of genes robustly oscillating in cardiovascular tissue, including key drug targets relevant to heart disease. These results also have implications for genetic studies where circadian variability may have masked genetic influence. It is our hope that the human enCYCLOPedia helps drive the translation of circadian biology into prospective clinical trials in cardiology and many other therapeutic areas.},

Notably, SNAP-25 has been implicated in schizophrenia from genetic [], pathological [], and functional studies []. We show here that the rest and activity rhythms of Bdr mice are phase advanced and fragmented under a light/dark cycle, reminiscent of the disturbed sleep patterns observed in schizophrenia. Retinal inputs appear normal in mutants, and clock gene rhythms within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are normally phased both in vitro and in vivo. However, the 24 hr rhythms of arginine vasopressin within the SCN and plasma corticosterone are both markedly phase advanced in Bdr mice. We suggest that the Bdr circadian phenotype arises from a disruption of synaptic connectivity within the SCN that alters critical output signals.

An integrated gene expression meta-analysis of five independent publicly available microarray data of the three diseases was conducted to identify shared gene expression signatures and overlapping biological processes. Using INMEX bioinformatic tool, based on combined Effect Size (ES) approaches, we identified a total of 1,157 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (697 overexpressed and 460 underexpressed genes) shared between the three diseases. EnrichR tool’s rich library was used for comprehensive functional enrichment and pathway analysis which revealed “mRNA Splicing” and “SUMO E3 ligases SUMOylate target proteins” among the most enriched terms. Network based meta-analysis identified MYC and FN1 to be the most highly ranked hub genes. Our results reveal that the alterations in biomarkers of the coagulation cascade like F2R, PROS1, SELPLG and ITGB2 were common between the three diseases. Interestingly, the study has generated a novel database of candidate genetic markers, pathways and transcription factors shared between thrombosis and MPDs, which might aid in the development of prognostic therapeutic biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Background
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex, multi-systemic, autoimmune disease for which the underlying aetiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The genetic and molecular processes underlying lupus have been extensively investigated using a variety of -omics approaches, including genome-wide association studies, candidate gene studies and microarray experiments of differential gene expression in lupus samples compared to controls.

Methods
This study analyses a combination of existing microarray data sets to identify differentially regulated genetic pathways that are dysregulated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SLE patients compared to unaffected controls. Two statistical approaches, quantile discretisation and scaling, are used to combine publicly available expression microarray datasets and perform a meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes.

Results
Differentially expressed genes implicated in interferon signaling were identified by the meta-analysis, in agreement with the findings of the individual studies that generated the datasets used. In contrast to the individual studies, however, the meta-analysis and subsequent pathway analysis additionally highlighted TLR signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and diapedesis and adhesion regulatory networks as being differentially regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SLE patients compared to controls.

Conclusion
Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to derive additional information from publicly available expression data using meta-analysis techniques, which is particularly relevant to research into rare diseases where sample numbers can be limiting.

	abstract = {Recently, we identified and characterized a novel protein, granuphilin, whose domain structure is similar to that of the Rab3 effector protein rabphilin3 (J. Wang, T. Takeuchi, H. Yokota, and T. Izumi, J. Biol. Chem. 274:28542-28548, 1999). Screening its possible Rab partner by a yeast two-hybrid system revealed that an amino-terminal zinc-finger domain of granuphilin interacts with Rab27a. Granuphilin preferentially bound to the GTP form of Rab27a. Formation of the Rab27a/granuphilin complex was readily detected in the pancreatic beta cell line MIN6. Moreover, the tissue distributions of Rab27a and granuphilin are remarkably similar: both had significant and specific expression in pancreatic islets and in pituitary tissue, but no expression was noted in the brain. Analyses by immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, and sucrose density gradient subcellular fractionation showed that Rab27a and granuphilin are localized on the membrane of insulin granules. These findings suggest that granuphilin functions as a Rab27a effector protein in beta cells. Overexpression of wild-type Rab27a and its GTPase-deficient mutant significantly enhanced high K(+)-induced insulin secretion without affecting basal insulin release. Although Rab3a, another exocytotic Rab protein, has some similarities with Rab27a in primary sequence, intracellular distribution, and affinity toward granuphilin, overexpression of Rab3a caused different effects on insulin secretion. These results indicate that Rab27a is involved in the regulated exocytosis of conventional dense-core granules possibly through the interaction with granuphilin, in addition to its recently identified role in lysosome-related organelles.},

To more systematically ascertain and learn from cellular specializations in the brain, we used Drop-seq to perform single-cell RNA sequencing of 690,000 cells sampled from nine regions of the adult mouse brain: frontal and posterior cortex (156,000 and 99,000 cells, respectively), hippocampus (113,000), thalamus (89,000), cerebellum (26,000), and all of the basal ganglia - the striatum (77,000), globus pallidus externus/nucleus basalis (66,000), entopeduncular/subthalamic nuclei (19,000), and the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (44,000). We developed computational approaches to distinguish biological from technical signals in single-cell data, then identified 565 transcriptionally distinct groups of cells, which we annotate and present through interactive online software we developed for visualizing and re-analyzing these data (DropViz). Comparison of cell classes and types across regions revealed features of brain organization. These included a neuronal gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components; widely shared patterns in the combinatorial co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels by diverse neuronal populations; functional distinctions among cells of the brain vasculature; and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions to a degree not observed in other neuronal or non-neuronal populations. We describe systematic neuronal classifications for two complex, understudied regions of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus externus and substantia nigra reticulata. In the striatum, where neuron types have been intensely researched, our data reveal a previously undescribed population of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) comprising 4\% of SPNs.

	abstract = {Background
Imbalances in amount and timing of sleep are harmful to physical and mental health. Therefore, the study of the underlying mechanisms is of great biological importance. Proper timing and amount of sleep is regulated by both the circadian clock and homeostatic sleep drive. However, very little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the circadian clock regulates sleep. In this study we describe a novel role for DIURETIC HORMONE 31 (DH31), the fly homologue of the vertebrate neuropeptide CALCITONIN GENE RELATED PEPTIDE (CGRP), as a circadian wake-promoting signal that awakens the fly in anticipation of dawn.

Results
Analysis of loss-of-function and gain-of-function Drosophila mutants demonstrates that DH31 suppresses sleep late at night. DH31 is expressed by a subset of dorsal circadian clock neurons that also express the receptor for the circadian neuropeptide PIGMENT DISPERSING FACTOR (PDF). PDF secreted by the ventral pacemaker subset of circadian clock neurons acts on PDF receptors in the DH31-expressing dorsal clock neurons to increase DH31 secretion before dawn. Activation of PDFR in DH31 positive DN1 specifically affects sleep and has no effect on circadian rhythms, thus constituting a dedicated locus for circadian regulation of sleep.

Conclusions
We identified a novel signaling molecule (DH31) as part of a neuropeptide relay mechanism for circadian control of sleep. Our results indicate that outputs of the clock controlling sleep and locomotor rhythms are mediated via distinct neuronal/cellular channels.},

Following fixation in paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and picric acid, excellent staining was obtained with two different TRH antisera. Many TRH-containing neurons were present in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), especially in the dorsocaudal part of this nucleus. They were mostly parvicellular, but a few magnocellular TRH-positive neurons were observed as well. The PVN also contained a dense network of TRH fibers. The supraoptic nucleus (SON) did not show any TRH immunoreactivity, excluding the possibility of cross-reactivity of the antiserum with neurohypophysial hormones or their precursors. In addition, TRH cells were found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the circadian clock of the brain, in the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) and dorsomedially of the SON. We observed small number of TRH cells throughout the hypothalamic gray in all subjects studied. A high density of TRH-containing fibers was seen not only in the median eminence but also in other hypothalamic areas, e.g., in the ventromedial nucleus (VM) and in the perifornical area. The results generally agree with earlier data in the rat, with the exception of the absence of TRH cells in the SON. The large number of sites of TRH-containing fiber terminations on neurons suggests important physiological functions of this neuropeptide as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the human brain, in addition to its role as a neurohormone in pituitary secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).},

We developed a computational method, termed MAGI (merging affected genes into integrated networks), that simultaneously integrates protein–protein interactions and RNA-seq expression profiles during brain development to discover “modules” enriched for de novo mutations in probands. We applied this method to recent exome sequencing of 1116 patients with autism and intellectual disability, discovering two distinct modules that differ in their properties and associated phenotypes. The first module consists of 80 genes associated with Wnt, Notch, SWI/SNF, and NCOR complexes and shows the highest expression early during embryonic development (8–16 post-conception weeks [pcw]). The second module consists of 24 genes associated with synaptic function, including long-term potentiation and calcium signaling with higher levels of postnatal expression. Patients with de novo mutations in these modules are more significantly intellectually impaired and carry more severe missense mutations when compared to probands with de novo mutations outside of these modules. We used our approach to define subsets of the network associated with higher functioning autism as well as greater severity with respect to IQ. Finally, we applied MAGI independently to epilepsy and schizophrenia exome sequencing cohorts and found significant overlap as well as expansion of these modules, suggesting a core set of integrated neurodevelopmental networks common to seemingly diverse human diseases.},

	abstract = {Despite considerable genetic heterogeneity underlying neurodevelopmental diseases, there is compelling evidence that many disease genes will map to a much smaller number of biological subnetworks. We developed a computational method, termed MAGI (merging affected genes into integrated networks), that simultaneously integrates protein–protein interactions and RNA-seq expression profiles during brain development to discover “modules” enriched for de novo mutations in probands. We applied this method to recent exome sequencing of 1116 patients with autism and intellectual disability, discovering two distinct modules that differ in their properties and associated phenotypes. The first module consists of 80 genes associated with Wnt, Notch, SWI/SNF, and NCOR complexes and shows the highest expression early during embryonic development (8–16 post-conception weeks [pcw]). The second module consists of 24 genes associated with synaptic function, including long-term potentiation and calcium signaling with higher levels of postnatal expression. Patients with de novo mutations in these modules are more significantly intellectually impaired and carry more severe missense mutations when compared to probands with de novo mutations outside of these modules. We used our approach to define subsets of the network associated with higher functioning autism as well as greater severity with respect to IQ. Finally, we applied MAGI independently to epilepsy and schizophrenia exome sequencing cohorts and found significant overlap as well as expansion of these modules, suggesting a core set of integrated neurodevelopmental networks common to seemingly diverse human diseases.},

	abstract = {Human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common types of malignant adult kidney tumors. We constructed a weighted gene co-expression network to identify gene modules associated with clinical features of ccRCC (n=97). Six hub genes (CCNB2, CDC20, CEP55, KIF20A, TOP2A and UBE2C) were identified in both co-expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, which were highly correlated with pathologic stage. The significance of expression of the hub genes in ccRCC was ranked top 4 among all cancers and correlated with poor prognosis. Functional analysis revealed that the hub genes were significantly enriched in cell cycle regulation and cell division. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that the samples with highly expressed hub gene were correlated with cell cycle and p53 signaling pathway. Taken together, six hub genes were identified to be associated with progression and prognosis of ccRCC, and they might lead to poor prognosis by regulating p53 signaling pathway.},

Recently, several large‐scale studies have shed light on this problem through analysis of gene expression profiles to identify markers correlated with metastasis. Here, we apply a protein‐network‐based approach that identifies markers not as individual genes but as subnetworks extracted from protein interaction databases. The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non‐metastatic tumors.},

In this review, we first describe the main policies and international initiatives that focus on precision medicine. Secondly, we review the currently ongoing clinical trials in precision medicine, introducing the concept of 'precision bioinformatics', and we describe current pioneering bioinformatics efforts aimed at implementing tools and computational infrastructures for precision medicine in health institutions around the world. Thirdly, we discuss the challenges related to the clinical training of bioinformaticians, and the urgent need for computational specialists capable of assimilating medical terminologies and protocols to address real clinical questions.

In the course of analyzing biological data for differential features such as genes or proteins, it derives from the situation where the null hypothesis is rejected for extraneous reasons (or confounders), rather than because the alternative hypothesis is relevant to the disease phenotype. The mechanics of applying statistical tests therefore must address and resolve confounders. It is inadequate to simply rely on manipulating the P-value. We discuss three mechanistic elements (hypothesis statement construction, null distribution appropriateness, and test-statistic construction) and suggest how they can be designed to foil the Anna Karenina effect to select phenotypically relevant biological features.},

	abstract = {A trend towards the abandonment of obtaining pure culture isolates in frontline laboratories is at a crossroads with the ability of public health agencies to perform their basic mandate of foodborne disease surveillance and response. The implementation of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) including nucleic acid and antigen-based assays for acute gastroenteritis is leaving public health agencies without laboratory evidence to link clinical cases to each other and to food or environmental substances. This limits the efficacy of public health epidemiology and surveillance as well as outbreak detection and investigation. Foodborne outbreaks have the potential to remain undetected or have insufficient evidence to support source attribution and may inadvertently increase the incidence of foodborne diseases. Next-generation sequencing of pure culture isolates in clinical microbiology laboratories has the potential to revolutionize the fields of food safety and public health. Metagenomics and other 'omics' disciplines could provide the solution to a cultureless future in clinical microbiology, food safety and public health. Data mining of information obtained from metagenomics assays can be particularly useful for the identification of clinical causative agents or foodborne contamination, detection of AMR and/or virulence factors, in addition to providing high-resolution subtyping data. Thus, metagenomics assays may provide a universal test for clinical diagnostics, foodborne pathogen detection, subtyping and investigation. This information has the potential to reform the field of enteric disease diagnostics and surveillance and also infectious diseases as a whole. The aim of this review will be to present the current state of CIDTs in diagnostic and public health laboratories as they relate to foodborne illness and food safety. Moreover, we will also discuss the diagnostic and subtyping utility and concomitant bias limitations of metagenomics and comparable detection techniques in clinical microbiology, food and public health laboratories. Early advances in the discipline of metagenomics, however, have indicated noteworthy challenges. Through forthcoming improvements in sequencing technology and analytical pipelines among others, we anticipate that within the next decade, detection and characterization of pathogens via metagenomics-based workflows will be implemented in routine usage in diagnostic and public health laboratories.},

	abstract = {DNA repair deficiency is a common hallmark of many cancers and is increasingly recognised as a target for cancer therapeutics. Selecting patients for these treatments requires a functional assessment of multiple redundant DNA repair pathways. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing of cancer genomes, it is increasingly recognised that multiple signatures of mutational and chromosomal alterations can be correlated with specific DNA repair defects. The clinical relevance of this approach is underlined by the use of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in homologous recombination (HR) deficient high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Beyond deleterious mutations in HR-related genes such as BRCA1/2, it is recognised that HR deficiency endows ovarian cancers with specific signatures of base substitutions and structural chromosomal variation. Multiple metrics quantifying loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events were proposed and implemented in trials with PARPi. However, it was shown that some of the HR-deficient cases, i.e. CDK12-mutated tumours, were not associated with high LOH-based scores, but with distinct patterns of genomic alterations such as tandem duplication. Therefore, more complex signatures of structural genomic variation were identified and quantified. Ultimately, optimal prediction models for treatments targeting DNA repair will need to integrate multiples of these genomic signatures and will also need to assess multiple resistance mechanisms such as genomic reversion events that partially or fully re-activate DNA repair.},

HBV integration into cancer-related genes is also a driver event in hepatocarcinogenesis. These genes are affected by structural variants, copy-number alterations and virus integrations as well as point mutations. Etiological factors of liver cancer is most understood among common cancers, such as hepatitis, aflatoxin, alcohol, and metabolic diseases, and mutational signatures of liver cancer can provide evidence of the association between specific etiological factors and mutational signatures. Molecular classifications based on somatic mutations profiles, RNA expression profiles, and DNA methylation profiles are related with patient prognosis.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, testing the genes of patients and their specific cancer types has become standardized practice in medical oncology since somatic mutations, changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications are all hallmarks of cancer. However, while cancer genetic assessment has been limited to single biomarkers to guide the use of therapies, improvements in nucleic acid sequencing technologies and implementation of different genome analysis tools have enabled clinicians to detect these genomic alterations and identify functional and disease-associated genomic variants. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have provided clues about therapeutic targets and genomic markers for novel clinical applications when standard therapy has failed. While Sanger sequencing, an accurate and sensitive approach, allows for the identification of potential novel variants, it is however limited by the single amplicon being interrogated. Similarly, quantitative and qualitative profiling of gene expression changes also represents a challenge for the cancer field. Both RT-PCR and microarrays are efficient approaches, but are limited to the genes present on the array or being assayed. This leaves vast swaths of the transcriptome, including non-coding RNAs and other features, unexplored. With the advent of the ability to collect and analyze genomic sequence data in a timely fashion and at an ever-decreasing cost, many of these limitations have been overcome and are being incorporated into cancer research and diagnostics giving patients and clinicians new hope for targeted and personalized treatment.

Like structured radiology reports, which enable faster information retrieval and reuse, structuring genetic information within clinical WES reports would help facilitate integration of genetic information into electronic health records and enable retrospective research on the clinical utility of WES. We identify elements listed as mandatory according to practice guidelines but are currently missing from some of the clinical reports, which might help to organize the data when stored within structured databases.

The development of high-throughput gene expression assays in the last two decades has provided the invaluable opportunity to improve our knowledge on cancer biology and to identify predictive signatures in the most deeply analyzed malignancies, such as hematological and breast cancers. At variance, till 2010, the number of reliable reports referring gene expression data related to HSNCC biology and prediction was quite limited. A critical revision of the literature reporting gene expression data in HNSCC indicated that in the last 6 years, there were new important studies with a relevant increase in the sample size and a more accurate selection of cases, the publication of a growing number of studies applying a computational integration (meta-analysis) of different microarray datasets addressing similar clinical/biological questions, the increased use of molecular sub-classification of tumors according to their gene expression, and the release of the publicly available largest dataset in HNSCC by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Overall, also for this disease, it become evident that the expression analysis of the entire transcriptome has been enabling to achieve the identification of promising molecular signatures for (i) disclosure of the biology behind carcinogenesis with special focus on the HPV-related one, (ii) prediction of tumor recurrence or metastasis development, (iii) identification of subgroups of tumors with different biology and associated prognosis, and (iv) prediction of outcome and/or response to therapy. The increasing awareness of the relevance of strict collaboration among clinicians and translational researchers would in a near future enable the application of a personalized HNSCCs patients' treatment in the clinical practice based also on gene expression signatures.},

These studies have identified new ALL subtypes, each characterized by constellations of structural and sequence alterations that perturb key cellular pathways, including lymphoid development, cell-cycle regulation, and tumor suppression; cytokine receptor, kinase, and Ras signaling; and chromatin modifications. Several of these pathways, particularly kinase-activating lesions and epigenetic alterations, are logical targets for new precision medicine therapies. Genomic profiling has also identified important interactions between inherited genetic variants that influence the risk of leukemia development and the somatic genetic alterations that are required to establish the leukemic clone. Moreover, sequential sequencing studies at diagnosis, remission, and relapse have provided important insights into the relationship among genetic variants, clonal heterogeneity, and the risk of relapse. Ongoing studies are extending our understanding of coding and noncoding genetic alterations in B-progenitor and T-lineage ALL and using these insights to inform the development of faithful experimental models to test the efficacy of new treatment approaches.},

	abstract = {Gastric cancer is the second after lung cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. Early detection and treatment can lead to a long survival time. Recently microarrays and next generation sequencing (NGS) have become very useful tools of comprehensive research into gastric cancer, facilitating the identification of treatment targets and personalized treatments. However, there are numerous challenges from cancer target discovery to practical clinical benefits. Although there are many biomarkers and target agents, only a minority of patients are tested and treated accordingly. Microarray technology with maturity was established more than 10 years ago, and has been widely used in the study of functional genomics, systems biology, and genomes in medicine. Second generation sequencing technology is more recent, but development is very fast, and it has been applied to the genome, including sequencing and epigenetics and many aspects of functional genomics. Here we review insights gained from these studies regarding the technology of microarray and NGS, how to elucidate the molecular basis of gastric cancer and identify potential therapeutic targets, and how to analyse candidate genes. We also discuss the challenges and future directions of such efforts.},

	abstract = {Cancer metabolism is currently re-evaluated by the research community with the aim to investigate possible opportunities for the development of targeted therapies. Firstly discovered by Warburg et al. in the beginning of the last century, it is now a widely accepted hypothesis that cancer cells possess a severely deregulated form of glycolysis also under aerobic conditions. Accompanied by a deregulated glycolysis is an increasing dependence on glucose and glutamine, this characteristic offers a striking opportunity for new kinds of anti-cancer drugs. A feasible approach in this endeavour is the combined use of metabolic and transcriptomic information. Microarrays provide nowadays a reliable way for accessing the transcriptomic layer, even higher layers of biological information are in the scope. In this review we present the possibilities and also the limitations of this technique starting from the early phase of the microarray to the modern concepts of bioinformatics and systems biology. By highlighting also clinicopathological possibilities it is demonstrated that microarray technology is able to integrate various layers of biological information. Case studies incorporating aspects of cancer metabolism into therapy relevant applications and some potential new targets of cancer metabolism for novel cancer therapies are pointed out. These new cancer therapies can lead to the establishment of personalized medicine by use of custom based microarray platforms introducing treatment options in clinical decision making.},

However new generation sequencing techniques are now being introduced in many clinical genetic contexts, particularly where novel mutations are involved. While these methods can be valuable for screening a restricted set of genes for known or novel mutations, implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical practice continues to present challenges. Even very accurate high-throughput methods with small error rates can generate large numbers of false negative or false positive errors due to the high numbers of simultaneous readings. Additional validation is likely to be required for safe use of any such methods in clinical settings. Custom-designed arrays can offer advantages for screening for common, known mutations and, in this context, may currently be better suited for accredited, quality-controlled clinical genetic screening services, as illustrated by their successful application in several large-scale pre-emptive pharmacogenomics programs now underway. Excessive, inappropriate use of next-generation sequencing may waste scarce research funds and other resources. Microarrays presently remain the technology of choice in applications that require fast, cost-effective genome-wide screening of variants of known importance, particularly for large sample sizes.

A new field of "precision medicine" has consequently emerged with specific clinical implications and challenges that can be well-addressed by newly developed nanomaterials. Here, a nanoscience approach to precision medicine is provided, with a focus on cancer therapy, based on a new concept of "molecularly-defined cancers." "Next-generation sequencing" is introduced to identify the oncogene that is responsible for a class of cancers. This new approach is fundamentally different from all conventional cancer therapies that rely on diagnosis of the anatomic origins where the tumors are found. To treat cancers at molecular level, a recently developed "microRNA replacement therapy" is applied, utilizing nanocarriers, in order to regulate the driver oncogene, which is the core of cancer precision therapeutics. Furthermore, the outcome of the nanomediated oncogenic regulation has to be accurately assessed by the genetically characterized, patient-derived xenograft models. Cancer therapy in this fashion is a quintessential example of precision medicine, presenting many challenges to the materials communities with new issues in structural design, surface functionalization, gene/drug storage and delivery, cell targeting, and medical imaging.},

However, individualised treatment, guided by detailed drug susceptibility testing, probably results in improved individual outcomes and is the standard of care in well-resourced settings. Driven by the urgent need to scale up treatment provision, new tuberculosis drugs, incorporated into standardised regimens, are being tested. Although standardised regimens are expected to improve access to treatment in high-burden settings, they are also likely to contribute to the emergence of resistance, even with good clinical management. We argue that a balance is required between the need to improve treatment access and the imperative to minimise resistance amplification and provide the highest standard of care, through a precision medicine approach. In tuberculosis, as in other diseases, we should aim to reduce the entrenched inequalities that manifest as different standards of care in different settings.},

Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can.

	abstract = {DNA repair deficiency is a common hallmark of many cancers and is increasingly recognised as a target for cancer therapeutics. Selecting patients for these treatments requires a functional assessment of multiple redundant DNA repair pathways. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing of cancer genomes, it is increasingly recognised that multiple signatures of mutational and chromosomal alterations can be correlated with specific DNA repair defects. The clinical relevance of this approach is underlined by the use of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in homologous recombination (HR) deficient high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Beyond deleterious mutations in HR-related genes such as BRCA1/2, it is recognised that HR deficiency endows ovarian cancers with specific signatures of base substitutions and structural chromosomal variation. Multiple metrics quantifying loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events were proposed and implemented in trials with PARPi. However, it was shown that some of the HR-deficient cases, i.e. CDK12-mutated tumours, were not associated with high LOH-based scores, but with distinct patterns of genomic alterations such as tandem duplication. Therefore, more complex signatures of structural genomic variation were identified and quantified. Ultimately, optimal prediction models for treatments targeting DNA repair will need to integrate multiples of these genomic signatures and will also need to assess multiple resistance mechanisms such as genomic reversion events that partially or fully re-activate DNA repair.},

	abstract = {A breakthrough in next generation sequencing (NGS) in the last decade provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate genetic variations in humans and their roles in health and disease. NGS offers regional genomic sequencing such as whole exome sequencing of coding regions of all genes, as well as whole genome sequencing. RNA-seq offers sequencing of the entire transcriptome and ChIP-seq allows for sequencing the epigenetic architecture of the genome. Identifying genetic variations in individuals can be used to predict disease risk, with the potential to halt or retard disease progression. NGS can also be used to predict the response to or adverse effects of drugs or to calculate appropriate drug dosage. Such a personalized medicine also provides the possibility to treat diseases based on the genetic makeup of the patient. Here, we review the basics of NGS technologies and their application in human diseases to foster human healthcare and personalized medicine.},

However, the informatics practice for handling information contained in whole exome reports is still in its infancy, as evidenced by the lack of a common vocabulary within clinical sequencing reports generated across genetic laboratories. Genetic testing results are mostly transmitted using portable document format, which can make secondary analysis and data extraction challenging. This paper reviews a sample of clinical exome reports generated by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified genetic testing laboratories at tertiary-care facilities to assess and identify common data elements. Like structured radiology reports, which enable faster information retrieval and reuse, structuring genetic information within clinical WES reports would help facilitate integration of genetic information into electronic health records and enable retrospective research on the clinical utility of WES. We identify elements listed as mandatory according to practice guidelines but are currently missing from some of the clinical reports, which might help to organize the data when stored within structured databases. We also highlight elements, such as patient consent, that, although they do not appear within any of the current reports, may help in interpreting some of the information within the reports. Integrating genetic and clinical information would assist the adoption of personalized medicine for improved patient care and outcomes.},

To better understand the impact of genes on disease and its implications for medicine and public health, researchers have pursued methods for determining the sequences of individual genes, then all genes, and now complete human genomes. Massively parallel high-throughput sequencing technology, where DNA is sheared into smaller pieces, sequenced, and then computationally reordered and analyzed, enables fast and affordable sequencing of full human genomes. As the price of sequencing continues to decline, more and more individuals are having their genomes sequenced. This may facilitate better population-level disease subtyping and characterization, as well as individual-level diagnosis and personalized treatment and prevention plans. In this review, we describe several massively parallel high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and their associated strengths, limitations, and error modes, with a focus on applications in epidemiologic research and precision medicine.

In the last decade, microarray and sequencing analysis of large ALL cohorts has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease. These studies have identified new ALL subtypes, each characterized by constellations of structural and sequence alterations that perturb key cellular pathways, including lymphoid development, cell-cycle regulation, and tumor suppression; cytokine receptor, kinase, and Ras signaling; and chromatin modifications. Several of these pathways, particularly kinase-activating lesions and epigenetic alterations, are logical targets for new precision medicine therapies. Genomic profiling has also identified important interactions between inherited genetic variants that influence the risk of leukemia development and the somatic genetic alterations that are required to establish the leukemic clone. Moreover, sequential sequencing studies at diagnosis, remission, and relapse have provided important insights into the relationship among genetic variants, clonal heterogeneity, and the risk of relapse. Ongoing studies are extending our understanding of coding and noncoding genetic alterations in B-progenitor and T-lineage ALL and using these insights to inform the development of faithful experimental models to test the efficacy of new treatment approaches.},

	abstract = {Cancer metabolism is currently re-evaluated by the research community with the aim to investigate possible opportunities for the development of targeted therapies. Firstly discovered by Warburg et al. in the beginning of the last century, it is now a widely accepted hypothesis that cancer cells possess a severely deregulated form of glycolysis also under aerobic conditions. Accompanied by a deregulated glycolysis is an increasing dependence on glucose and glutamine, this characteristic offers a striking opportunity for new kinds of anti-cancer drugs. A feasible approach in this endeavour is the combined use of metabolic and transcriptomic information. Microarrays provide nowadays a reliable way for accessing the transcriptomic layer, even higher layers of biological information are in the scope. In this review we present the possibilities and also the limitations of this technique starting from the early phase of the microarray to the modern concepts of bioinformatics and systems biology. By highlighting also clinicopathological possibilities it is demonstrated that microarray technology is able to integrate various layers of biological information. Case studies incorporating aspects of cancer metabolism into therapy relevant applications and some potential new targets of cancer metabolism for novel cancer therapies are pointed out. These new cancer therapies can lead to the establishment of personalized medicine by use of custom based microarray platforms introducing treatment options in clinical decision making.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical clustering (HC) is one of the most frequently used methods in computational biology in the analysis of high-dimensional genomics data. Given a data set, HC outputs a binary tree leaves of which are the data points and internal nodes represent clusters of various sizes. Normally, a fixed-height cut on the HC tree is chosen, and each contiguous branch of data points below that height is considered as a separate cluster. However, the fixed-height branch cut may not be ideal in situations where one expects a complicated tree structure with nested clusters. Furthermore, due to lack of utilization of related background information in selecting the cutoff, induced clusters are often difficult to interpret. This paper describes a novel procedure that aims to automatically extract meaningful clusters from the HC tree in a semi-supervised way. The procedure is implemented in the R package HCsnip available from Bioconductor. Rather than cutting the HC tree at a fixed-height, HCsnip probes the various way of snipping, possibly at variable heights, to tease out hidden clusters ensconced deep down in the tree. The cluster extraction process utilizes, along with the data set from which the HC tree is derived, commonly available background information. Consequently, the extracted clusters are highly reproducible and robust against various sources of variations that “haunted” high-dimensional genomics data. Since the clustering process is guided by the background information, clusters are easy to interpret. Unlike existing packages, no constraint is placed on the data type on which clustering is desired. Particularly, the package accepts patient follow-up data for guiding the cluster extraction process. To our knowledge, HCsnip is the first package that is able to decomposes the HC tree into clusters with piecewise snipping under the guidance of patient time-to-event information. Our implementation of the semi-supervised HC tree snipping framework is generic, and can be combined with other algorithms that operate on detected clusters.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Alternative usage of transcript isoforms from the same gene has been hypothesized as an important feature in cancers. However, differential usage of gene transcripts between conditions - isoform switching - has not been comprehensively characterized in and across cancer types. To this end, we developed methods for identification and visualization of isoform switches with predicted functional consequences. Using these methods, we characterized isoform switching in RNA-seq data from {\textgreater}5500 cancer patients covering 12 solid cancer types. Isoform switches with potential functional consequences were common, affecting {\textasciitilde}19\% of multiple-transcript genes. Amongst these, isoform switches leading to loss of DNA sequence encoding protein domains were more frequent than expected, particularly in pan-cancer switches. We identified several isoform switches as powerful biomarkers: 31 switches were highly predictive of patient survival independent of cancer types. Our data constitute an important resource for cancer researchers, available through interactive web tools. Moreover, our methods, available as an R package, enable systematic analysis of isoform switches from other RNA-seq data sets. Implications: Implications: This study indicates that isoform switches with predicted functional consequences are common and important in dysfunctional cells, which in turn means that gene expression should be analyzed on the isoform level.},

	doi = {10.1242/dmm.010322},
	abstract = {Numerous disease syndromes are associated with regions of copy number variation (CNV) in the human genome and, in most cases, the pathogenicity of the CNV is thought to be related to altered dosage of the genes contained within the affected segment. However, establishing the contribution of individual genes to the overall pathogenicity of CNV syndromes is difficult and often relies on the identification of potential candidates through manual searches of the literature and online resources. We describe here the development of a computational framework to comprehensively search phenotypic information from model organisms and single-gene human hereditary disorders, and thus speed the interpretation of the complex phenotypes of CNV disorders. There are currently more than 5000 human genes about which nothing is known phenotypically but for which detailed phenotypic information for the mouse and/or zebrafish orthologs is available. Here, we present an ontology-based approach to identify similarities between human disease manifestations and the mutational phenotypes in characterized model organism genes; this approach can therefore be used even in cases where there is little or no information about the function of the human genes. We applied this algorithm to detect candidate genes for 27 recurrent CNV disorders and identified 802 gene-phenotype associations, approximately half of which involved genes that were previously reported to be associated with individual phenotypic features and half of which were novel candidates. A total of 431 associations were made solely on the basis of model organism phenotype data. Additionally, we observed a striking, statistically significant tendency for individual disease phenotypes to be associated with multiple genes located within a single CNV region, a phenomenon that we denote as pheno-clustering. Many of the clusters also display statistically significant similarities in protein function or vicinity within the protein-protein interaction network. Our results provide a basis for understanding previously un-interpretable genotype-phenotype correlations in pathogenic CNVs and for mobilizing the large amount of model organism phenotype data to provide insights into human genetic disorders.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

Mortality from trauma is the number one cause of death under the age of 45 in the US and is the third leading cause of death for all age groups. There are nearly 200,000 deaths per year due to trauma in the US at a cost of over \$671 billion in combined health care costs and lost productivity. Unsurprisingly, trauma accounts for about 30\% of all life-years lost in the US. Due to immense development of trauma systems, a large majority of trauma patients survive the injury but then go on to die from complications arising from the injury. These complications are marked by early and significant metabolic changes accompanied by inflammatory responses that lead to progressive organ failure, and ultimately, death. Early resuscitative and surgical interventions followed by close monitoring to identify and rescue treatment failures are key to successful outcomes. Currently, the adequacy of resuscitation is measured using vital signs, noninvasive methods such as bedside echocardiography or stroke volume variation, and other laboratory endpoints of resuscitation, such as lactate and base deficit. However, these methods may be too crude to understand cellular and subcellular changes that may be occurring in trauma patients. Better diagnostic and therapeutic markers are needed to assess the adequacy of interventions and monitor responses at a cellular and subcellular level and inform clinical decision making before complications are clinically apparent.

In this context, treatment decisions are based on the clinical stage of disease but fail to ascertain the individual ´s underlying biology and its role in driving malignancy. The identification of better therapies for cancer treatment is thus limited by the lack of sufficient data regarding the characterization of specific biochemical signatures associated with each particular cancer patient or group of patients. Metabolomics approaches promise a better understanding of cancer, a disease characterized by significant alterations in bioenergetic metabolism, by identifying changes in the pattern of metabolite expression in addition to changes in the concentration of individual metabolites as well as alterations in biochemical pathways. These approaches hold the potential of identifying novel biomarkers with different clinical applications, including the development of more specific diagnostic methods based on the characterization of metabolic subtypes, the monitoring of currently used cancer therapeutics to evaluate the response and the prognostic outcome with a given therapy, and the evaluation of the mechanisms involved in disease relapse and drug resistance.

	abstract = {Guidance has been published on the choice of initial insulin regimen for patients with type 2 diabetes [NPH (isophane) insulin or a long-acting insulin analogue] but not on how to choose a second regimen when glycaemic control becomes unsatisfactory.
AIMS: To develop pragmatic clinical guidance for choosing a second-line insulin regimen tailored to the individual needs of patients with type 2 diabetes after failure of first-line insulin therapy.
METHODS: Formulation of a consensus by expert panel based on published evidence and best clinical practice, taking into account patient preferences, lifestyle and functional capacity.
RESULTS: Six patient-dependent factors relevant to the choice of second-line insulin regimen and three alternative insulin regimens (twice-daily premixed, basal-plus and basal-bolus) were identified. The panel recommended one or more insulin regimens compatible with each factor, emphasising the fundamental importance of a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise and weight reduction. These recommendations were incorporated into an algorithm to provide pragmatic guidance for clinicians.
CONCLUSION: The three alternative insulin regimens offer different benefits and drawbacks and it is important to make the right choice to optimise outcomes for patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers among women worldwide, characterized by diverse biological heterogeneity. It is well known that complex and combined gene regulation of multi-omics is involved in the occurrence and development of breast cancer.
RESULTS: In this paper, we present the Multi-Omics Breast Cancer Database (MOBCdb), a simple and easily accessible repository that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, clinical, and drug response data of different subtypes of breast cancer. MOBCdb allows users to retrieve simple nucleotide variation (SNV), gene expression, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, and specific drug response data by various search fashions. The genome-wide browser /navigation facility in MOBCdb provides an interface for visualizing multi-omics data of multi-samples simultaneously. Furthermore, the survival module provides survival analysis for all or some of the samples by using data of three omics. The approved public drugs with genetic variations on breast cancer are also included in MOBCdb.
CONCLUSION: In summary, MOBCdb provides users a unique web interface to the integrated multi-omics data of different subtypes of breast cancer, which enables the users to identify potential novel biomarkers for precision medicine.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Tumor sample classification has long been an important task in cancer research. Classifying tumors into different subtypes greatly benefits therapeutic development and facilitates application of precision medicine on patients. In practice, solid tumor tissue samples obtained from clinical settings are always mixtures of cancer and normal cells. Thus, the data obtained from these samples are mixed signals. The 'tumor purity', or the percentage of cancer cells in cancer tissue sample, will bias the clustering results if not properly accounted for.
Results: In this article, we developed a model-based clustering method and an R function which uses DNA methylation microarray data to infer tumor subtypes with the consideration of tumor purity. Simulation studies and the analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas data demonstrate improved results compared with existing methods.

Therapeutic interventions for IBS with diarrhea that are thought to target alterations in the gut microbiota include the nonsystemic antibiotic rifaximin, the medical food serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin, prebiotics, probiotics, and dietary modification. SYN-010 is a modified-release statin formulation that reduces methane production by Methanobrevibacter smithii and is currently in development for the treatment of patients with constipation-predominant IBS.

In the past decade, the interactions between microorganisms and tumors have attracted much attention in the efforts understanding various features of the complex microbial communities, as well as the possible mechanisms through which the microbiota are involved in cancer prevention, carcinogenesis, and anti-cancer therapy. A large number of studies have indicated that microbial dysbiosis contributes to cancer susceptibility via multiple pathways. Further studies have suggested that the microbiota and their associated metabolites are not only closely related to carcinogenesis by inducing inflammation and immune dysregulation, which lead to genetic instability, but also interfere with the pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents. In this article, we mainly reviewed the influence of gut microbiota on cancers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (including esophageal, gastric, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers) and the regulation of microbiota by diet, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, or traditional Chinese medicine. We also proposed some new strategies in the prevention and treatment of GI cancers that could be explored in the future. We hope that this review could provide a comprehensive overview of the studies on the interactions between the gut microbiota and GI cancers, which are likely to yield translational opportunities to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality by improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.},

This hypothesis is supported by observed long-term benefits associated with breastfeeding, such as better cognitive development in childhood, and lower risks of obesity and high blood pressure in later life. However, the possible underlying mechanisms are expected to be complex and may be difficult to disentangle due to the lack of understanding of the metabolic processes that differentiate breastfed infants compared to those receiving just formula feed.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the relationships between infant feeding and the lipid profiles and to validate specific lipids in separate datasets so that a small set of lipids can be used as nutritional biomarkers.
METHOD: We utilized a direct infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry method to analyse the lipid profiles of 3.2 mm dried blood spot samples collected at age 3 months from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-1), which formed the discovery cohort. For validation two sample sets were profiled: Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-2) and Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study (POPS). Lipidomic profiles were compared between infant groups who were either exclusively breastfed, exclusively formula-fed or mixed-fed at various levels. Data analysis included supervised Random Forest method with combined classification and regression mode. Selection of lipids was based on an iterative backward elimination procedure without compromising the class error in the classification mode.
CONCLUSION: From this study, we were able to identify and validate three lipids: PC(35:2), SM(36:2) and SM(39:1) that can be used collectively as biomarkers for infant nutrition during early development.

OBJECTIVES: To determine which single or combination of systemic and mucosal routes of immunizations of female rhesus macaques with an HIV-1 SF162 envelope protein vaccine induced protection against intravaginal challenge with SHIV.
DESIGN: Female rhesus macaques were immunized with an HIV-1 SF162 envelope protein vaccine administered systemically (intramuscularly), or mucosally (intranasally), or as a sequential combination of both routes. The macaques were then challenged intravaginally with SHIV SF162P4, expressing an envelope that is closely matched (homologous) to the vaccine.
RESULTS: Macaques receiving intramuscular immunizations, alone or in combination with intranasal immunizations, were protected from infection, with no detectable plasma viral RNA, provirus, or seroconversion to nonvaccine viral proteins, and better preservation of intestinal CD4+ T cells. Serum neutralizing antibodies against the challenge virus appeared to correlate with protection.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that, in the nonhuman primate model, it is possible for vaccine-elicited immune responses to prevent infection after intravaginal administration of virus.},

Health care under precision medicine will become a more integrated, dynamic system, in which patients are no longer a passive entity on whom measurements are made, but instead are central stakeholders who contribute data and participate actively in shared decision-making. Many traditionally defined diseases have common mechanisms; therefore, elimination of a siloed approach to medicine will ultimately pave the path to the creation of a universal precision medicine environment.},

Genomic medicine, which is the use of information from genomes and their derivatives (RNA, proteins, and metabolites) to guide medical decision making-is a key component of personalized medicine, which is a rapidly advancing field of health care that is informed by each person's unique clinical, genetic, genomic, and environmental information. As medicine begins to embrace genomic tools that enable more precise prediction and treatment disease, which include "whole genome" interrogation of sequence variation, transcription, proteins, and metabolites, the fundamentals of genomic and personalized medicine will require the development, standardization, and integration of several important tools into health systems and clinical workflows. These tools include health risk assessment, family health history, and clinical decision support for complex risk and predictive information. Together with genomic information, these tools will enable a paradigm shift to a comprehensive approach that will identify individual risks and guide clinical management and decision making, all of which form the basis for a more informed and effective approach to patient care. DNA-based risk assessment for common complex disease, molecular signatures for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and genome-guided therapy and dose selection are just among the few important examples for which genome information has already enabled personalized health care along the continuum from health to disease. In addition, information from individual genomes, which is a fast-moving area of technological development, is spawning a social and information revolution among consumers that will undoubtedly affect health care decision making. Although these and other scientific findings are making their way from the genome to the clinic, the full application of genomic and personalized medicine in health care will require dramatic changes in regulatory and reimbursement policies as well as legislative protections for privacy for system-wide adoption. Thus, there are challenges from both a scientific and a policy perspective to personalized health care; however, they will be confronted and solved with the certainty that the science behind genomic medicine is sound and the practice of medicine that it informs is evidence based.},

	abstract = {Few areas in modern medicine provide a better example of evidence-based data than the anatomic pathologists' classification of fully developed malignancies. Beginning with the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, morphologic tools also were applied to specimens obtained in cancer screening programs directed at large, asymptomatic patient populations. The Papanicolaou test was quickly responsible for a reduction in the incidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, proving the concept that screening could interdict the development of advanced malignancy. Other screening programs followed the Papanicolaou test initiative, producing a revolutionary change in the specimens submitted to pathologists. Cancer screening generates specimens containing morphologic deviations from normal that are thought to put currently healthy patients at risk of future malignancy. However, translating morphologic findings in such samples into risk estimates raises a number of statistical and ethical problems. When diagnostic thresholds are set to favor specificity, unwanted false-negative results accrue. Conversely, aiming at sensitivity over specificity is associated with biologically false-positive results, which are likewise undesirable. Pathologists interpreting these specimens find themselves facing a screening paradox. These screening programs attempt to discover the very earliest changes of neoplastic transformation, but these same earliest changes are inherently the most difficult to identify with precision and accuracy. This paper discusses these challenges.},

Precision oncology has been at the vanguard to leverage this potential of "Big data" and samples into meaningful solutions for patients, considering the need for new drug development approaches in this area (due to high costs, late-stage failures, and the molecular diversity of cancer). To harness the potential of the vast quantities of data and samples currently fragmented across databases and biobanks, it is critical to engage all stakeholders and share data and samples across research institutes. Here, we identified two general types of sharing strategies. First, open access models, characterized by the absence of any review panel or decision maker, and second controlled access model where some form of control is exercised by either the donor (i.e., patient), the data provider (i.e., initial organization), or an independent party. Further, we theoretically describe and provide examples of nine different strategies focused on greater sharing of patient data and material. These models provide varying levels of control, access to various data and/or samples, and different types of relationship between the donor, data provider, and data requester. We propose a tiered model to share clinical data and samples that takes into account privacy issues and respects sponsors' legitimate interests. Its implementation would contribute to maximize the value of existing datasets, enabling unraveling the complexity of tumor biology, identify novel biomarkers, and re-direct treatment strategies better, ultimately to help patients with cancer.},

To provide a fundamental understanding of how the network information is relevant to phenotype-gene associations, we analyze the circular bigraphs (CBGs) in OMIM human disease phenotype-gene association network and MGI mouse phentoype-gene association network, and introduce a bi-random walk (BiRW) algorithm to capture the CBG patterns in the networks for unveiling human and mouse phenome-genome association. BiRW performs separate random walk simultaneously on gene interaction network and phenotype similarity network to explore gene paths and phenotype paths in CBGs of different sizes to summarize their associations as predictions. Results The analysis of both OMIM and MGI associations revealed that majority of the phenotype-gene associations are covered by CBG patterns of small path lengths, and there is a clear correlation between the CBG coverage and the predictability of the phenotype-gene associations. In the experiments on recovering known associations in cross-validations on human disease phenotypes and mouse phenotypes, BiRW effectively improved prediction performance over the compared methods. The constructed global human disease phenome-genome association map also revealed interesting new predictions and phenotype-gene modules by disease classes.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-017-1854-y},
	abstract = {Background
The prediction of human gene–abnormal phenotype associations is a fundamental step toward the discovery of novel genes associated with human disorders, especially when no genes are known to be associated with a specific disease. In this context the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standard categorization of the abnormalities associated with human diseases. While the problem of the prediction of gene–disease associations has been widely investigated, the related problem of gene–phenotypic feature (i.e., HPO term) associations has been largely overlooked, even if for most human genes no HPO term associations are known and despite the increasing application of the HPO to relevant medical problems. Moreover most of the methods proposed in literature are not able to capture the hierarchical relationships between HPO terms, thus resulting in inconsistent and relatively inaccurate predictions.

Results
We present two hierarchical ensemble methods that we formally prove to provide biologically consistent predictions according to the hierarchical structure of the HPO. The modular structure of the proposed methods, that consists in a “flat” learning first step and a hierarchical combination of the predictions in the second step, allows the predictions of virtually any flat learning method to be enhanced. The experimental results show that hierarchical ensemble methods are able to predict novel associations between genes and abnormal phenotypes with results that are competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms and with a significant reduction of the computational complexity.

Conclusions
Hierarchical ensembles are efficient computational methods that guarantee biologically meaningful predictions that obey the true path rule, and can be used as a tool to improve and make consistent the HPO terms predictions starting from virtually any flat learning method. The implementation of the proposed methods is available as an R package from the CRAN repository.

	abstract = {The key question of precision medicine is whether it is possible to find clinically actionable granularity in diagnosing disease and classifying patient risk. The advent of next-generation sequencing and the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) have provided clinicians and researchers a wealth of data and made possible the precise characterization of individual patient genotypes and phenotypes. Unstructured text-found in biomedical publications and clinical notes-is an important component of genotype and phenotype knowledge. Publications in the biomedical literature provide essential information for interpreting genetic data. Likewise, clinical notes contain the richest source of phenotype information in EHRs. Text mining can render these texts computationally accessible and support information extraction and hypothesis generation. This chapter reviews the mechanics of text mining in precision medicine and discusses several specific use cases, including database curation for personalized cancer medicine, patient outcome prediction from EHR-derived cohorts, and pharmacogenomic research. Taken as a whole, these use cases demonstrate how text mining enables effective utilization of existing knowledge sources and thus promotes increased value for patients and healthcare systems. Text mining is an indispensable tool for translating genotype-phenotype data into effective clinical care that will undoubtedly play an important role in the eventual realization of precision medicine.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Universal HIV screening programs are costly, labor intensive, and often fail to identify high-risk individuals. Automated risk assessment methods that leverage longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) could catalyze targeted screening programs. Although social and behavioral determinants of health are typically captured in narrative documentation, previous analyses have considered only structured EHR fields. We examined whether natural language processing (NLP) would improve predictive models of HIV diagnosis.
METHODS: One hundred eighty-one HIV+ individuals received care at New York Presbyterian Hospital before a confirmatory HIV diagnosis and 543 HIV negative controls were selected using propensity score matching and included in the study cohort. EHR data including demographics, laboratory tests, diagnosis codes, and unstructured notes before HIV diagnosis were extracted for modeling. Three predictive algorithms were developed using machine-learning algorithms: (1) a baseline model with only structured EHR data, (2) baseline plus NLP topics, and (3) baseline plus NLP clinical keywords.
RESULTS: Predictive models demonstrated a range of performance with F measures of 0.59 for the baseline model, 0.63 for the baseline + NLP topic model, and 0.74 for the baseline + NLP keyword model. The baseline + NLP keyword model yielded the highest precision by including keywords including "msm," "unprotected," "hiv," and "methamphetamine," and structured EHR data indicative of additional HIV risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: NLP improved the predictive performance of automated HIV risk assessment by extracting terms in clinical text indicative of high-risk behavior. Future studies should explore more advanced techniques for extracting social and behavioral determinants from clinical text.},

	doi = {10.1093/jamia/ocx059},
	abstract = {Objective: Understanding how to identify the social determinants of health from electronic health records (EHRs) could provide important insights to understand health or disease outcomes. We developed a methodology to capture 2 rare and severe social determinants of health, homelessness and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), from a large EHR repository.
Materials and Methods: We first constructed lexicons to capture homelessness and ACE phenotypic profiles. We employed word2vec and lexical associations to mine homelessness-related words. Next, using relevance feedback, we refined the 2 profiles with iterative searches over 100 million notes from the Vanderbilt EHR. Seven assessors manually reviewed the top-ranked results of 2544 patient visits relevant for homelessness and 1000 patients relevant for ACE.
Results: word2vec yielded better performance (area under the precision-recall curve [AUPRC] of 0.94) than lexical associations (AUPRC = 0.83) for extracting homelessness-related words. A comparative study of searches for the 2 phenotypes revealed a higher performance achieved for homelessness (AUPRC = 0.95) than ACE (AUPRC = 0.79). A temporal analysis of the homeless population showed that the majority experienced chronic homelessness. Most ACE patients suffered sexual (70\%) and/or physical (50.6\%) abuse, with the top-ranked abuser keywords being "father" (21.8\%) and "mother" (15.4\%). Top prevalent associated conditions for homeless patients were lack of housing (62.8\%) and tobacco use disorder (61.5\%), while for ACE patients it was mental disorders (36.6\%-47.6\%).
Conclusion: We provide an efficient solution for mining homelessness and ACE information from EHRs, which can facilitate large clinical and genetic studies of these social determinants of health.},

We describe the implementation of a pediatric biobank, comprised of a fully-informed patient cohort linking specimens to phenotypic data derived from electronic health records (EHR). The Biobank was launched after multiple stakeholders' input and implemented initially in a pilot phase before hospital-wide expansion in 2016. In-person informed consent is obtained from all participants enrolling in the Biobank and provides permission to: (1) access EHR data for research; (2) collect and use residual specimens produced as by-products of routine care; and (3) share de-identified data and specimens outside of the institution. Participants are recruited throughout the hospital, across diverse clinical settings. We have enrolled 4900 patients to date, and 41\% of these have an associated blood sample for DNA processing. Current efforts are focused on aligning the Biobank with other ongoing research efforts at our institution and extending our electronic consenting system to support remote enrollment. A number of pediatric-specific challenges and opportunities is reviewed, including the need to re-consent patients when they reach 18 years of age, the ability to enroll family members accompanying patients and alignment with disease-specific research efforts at our institution and other pediatric centers to increase cohort sizes, particularly for rare diseases.},

	shorttitle = {Does the implementation of an electronic prescribing system create unintended medication errors?},
	doi = {10.1186/1472-6947-11-29},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even though electronic prescribing systems are widely advocated as one of the most effective means of improving patient safety, they may also introduce new risks that are not immediately obvious. Through the study of specific incidents related to the processes involved in the administration of medication, we sought to find out if the prescribing system had unintended consequences in creating new errors. The focus of this study was a large acute hospital in the Midlands in the United Kingdom, which implemented a Prescribing, Information and Communication System (PICS).
METHODS: This exploratory study was based on a survey of routinely collected medication incidents over five months. Data were independently reviewed by two of the investigators with a clinical pharmacology and nursing background respectively, and grouped into broad types: sociotechnical incidents (related to human interactions with the system) and non-sociotechnical incidents. Sociotechnical incidents were distinguished from the others because they occurred at the point where the system and the professional intersected and would not have occurred in the absence of the system. The day of the week and time of day that an incident occurred were tested using univariable and multivariable analyses. We acknowledge the limitations of conducting analyses of data extracted from incident reports as it is widely recognised that most medication errors are not reported and may contain inaccurate data. Interpretation of results must therefore be tentative.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 485 incidents, a modest 15\% (n = 73) were distinguished as sociotechnical issues and thus may be unique to hospitals that have such systems in place. These incidents were further analysed and subdivided into categories in order to identify aspects of the context which gave rise to adverse situations and possible risks to patient safety. The analysis of sociotechnical incidents by time of day and day of week indicated a trend for increased proportions of these types of incidents occurring on Sundays.
CONCLUSION: Introducing an electronic prescribing system has the potential to give rise to new types of risks to patient safety. Being aware of these types of errors is important to the clinical and technical implementers of such systems in order to, where possible, design out unintended problems, highlight training requirements, and revise clinical practice protocols.},

DESIGN: We used a qualitative research design to conduct a thematic analysis of free text entered into an electronic prescribing system.
SETTING: The study took place in a large University teaching hospital, which has a locally developed electronic prescribing system known as PICS (Prescribing, Information and Communication System).
PARTICIPANTS: We extracted prescription data from all inpatient admissions over a 7-month period in 2012 using the audit database of PICS.
INTERVENTION: The completion of the VTE risk assessment form introduced into the hospital-wide electronic prescribing and health records system is mandatory. Where doctors do not prescribe VTE prophylaxis when recommended, they are asked to provide a reason for this decision. The free-text field was introduced in May 2012.

This paper presents an ontology-based semantic search method, referred to as influential SemSim (i-SemSim), which relies on the Bayesian probabilistic approach for weighting the reference ontology. The Bayesian approach seems promising when the reference ontology is organized according to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In particular, in the proposed method the similarity among a user request and semantically annotated resources is evaluated. The user request, as well as each annotated resource, is represented by a set of concepts of the reference ontology. The experimental results of this paper show that the adoption of the Bayesian method for weighting DAG-based reference ontologies allows i-SemSim to outperform the most representative methods selected in the literature.},

We assessed a variety of RNA-seq expression data to determine factors affecting functional connectivity and topology in co-expression networks.Results: We examine RNA-seq co-expression data generated from 1970 RNA-seq samples using a Guilt-By-Association framework, in which genes are assessed for the tendency of co-expression to reflect shared function. Minimal experimental criteria to obtain performance on par with microarrays were \&gt;20 samples with read depth \&gt;10 M per sample. While the aggregate network constructed shows good performance (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ∼0.71), the dependency on number of experiments used is nearly identical to that present in microarrays, suggesting thousands of samples are required to obtain ‘gold-standard’ co-expression. We find a major topological difference between RNA-seq and microarray co-expression in the form of low overlaps between hub-like genes from each network due to changes in the correlation of expression noise within each technology.Contact:jgillis@cshl.edu or sballouz@cshl.eduSupplementary information: Networks are available at: http://gillislab.labsites.cshl.edu/supplements/rna-seq-networks/ and supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {The reductionist approach of dissecting biological systems into their constituents has been successful in the first stage of the molecular biology to elucidate the chemical basis of several biological processes. This knowledge helped biologists to understand the complexity of the biological systems evidencing that most biological functions do not arise from individual molecules; thus, realizing that the emergent properties of the biological systems cannot be explained or be predicted by investigating individual molecules without taking into consideration their relations. Thanks to the improvement of the current -omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships, even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory. Genomic and proteomic data are often combined with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological, functional, and disease modules. On the other hand, co-expression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on PPIs. Based on these premises, we introduce the reader to the PPI and to the co-expression networks, including aspects of reconstruction and analysis. In particular, the new idea to evaluate large-scale proteomic data by means of co-expression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application. Their use to infer biological knowledge will be shown, and a special attention will be devoted to the topological and module analysis.},

	abstract = {The sequencing of the transcriptome of single cells, or single-cell RNA-sequencing, has now become the dominant technology for the identification of novel cell types in heterogeneous cell populations or for the study of stochastic gene expression. In recent years, various experimental methods and computational tools for analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing data have been proposed. However, most of them are tailored to different experimental designs or biological questions, and in many cases, their performance has not been benchmarked yet, thus increasing the difficulty for a researcher to choose the optimal single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiment and analysis workflow. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the current available experimental and computational methods developed to handle single-cell RNA-sequencing data and, based on their peculiarities, we suggest possible analysis frameworks depending on specific experimental designs. Together, we propose an evaluation of challenges and open questions and future perspectives in the field. In particular, we go through the different steps of scRNA-seq experimental protocols such as cell isolation, messenger RNA capture, reverse transcription, amplification and use of quantitative standards such as spike-ins and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). We then analyse the current methodological challenges related to preprocessing, alignment, quantification, normalization, batch effect correction and methods to control for confounding effects.},

We report the analytical validation processes for the next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that was tailored for regulatory compliant use in the trial. The Oncomine Cancer Panel assay and the Personal Genome Machine were used in four networked laboratories accredited for the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical specimens and cell lines, we found that the assay achieved overall sensitivity of 96.98\% for 265 known mutations and 99.99\% specificity. High reproducibility in detecting all reportable variants was observed, with a 99.99\% mean interoperator pairwise concordance across the four laboratories. The limit of detection for each variant type was 2.8\% for single-nucleotide variants, 10.5\% for insertion/deletions, 6.8\% for large insertion/deletions (gap ≥4 bp), and four copies for gene amplification. The assay system from biopsy collection through reporting was tested and found to be fully fit for purpose. Our results indicate that the NCI-MATCH NGS assay met the criteria for the intended clinical use and that high reproducibility of a complex NGS assay is achievable across multiple clinical laboratories. Our validation approaches can serve as a template for development and validation of other NGS assays for precision medicine.},

OMIM is based on the published peer-reviewed biomedical literature and is used by overlapping and diverse communities of clinicians, molecular biologists and genome scientists, as well as by students and teachers of these disciplines. Genes and phenotypes are described in separate entries and are given unique, stable six-digit identifiers (MIM numbers). OMIM entries have a structured free-text format that provides the flexibility necessary to describe the complex and nuanced relationships between genes and genetic phenotypes in an efficient manner. OMIM also has a derivative table of genes and genetic phenotypes, the Morbid Map. OMIM.org has enhanced search capabilities such as genome coordinate searching and thesaurus-enhanced search term options. Phenotypic series have been created to facilitate viewing genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes. Clinical synopsis features are enhanced with UMLS, Human Phenotype Ontology and Elements of Morphology terms and image links. All OMIM data are available for FTP download and through an API. MIMmatch is a novel outreach feature to disseminate updates and encourage collaboration.},

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa0902542},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Granulosa-cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common type of malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor (SCST). The pathogenesis of these tumors is unknown. Moreover, their histopathological diagnosis can be challenging, and there is no curative treatment beyond surgery.
METHODS: We analyzed four adult-type GCTs using whole-transcriptome paired-end RNA sequencing. We identified putative GCT-specific mutations that were present in at least three of these samples but were absent from the transcriptomes of 11 epithelial ovarian tumors, published human genomes, and databases of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We confirmed these variants by direct sequencing of complementary DNA and genomic DNA. We then analyzed additional tumors and matched normal genomic DNA, using a combination of direct sequencing, analyses of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms, and TaqMan assays.
RESULTS: All four index GCTs had a missense point mutation, 402C--{\textgreater}G (C134W), in FOXL2, a gene encoding a transcription factor known to be critical for granulosa-cell development. The FOXL2 mutation was present in 86 of 89 additional adult-type GCTs (97\%), in 3 of 14 thecomas (21\%), and in 1 of 10 juvenile-type GCTs (10\%). The mutation was absent in 49 SCSTs of other types and in 329 unrelated ovarian or breast tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Whole-transcriptome sequencing of four GCTs identified a single, recurrent somatic mutation (402C--{\textgreater}G) in FOXL2 that was present in almost all morphologically identified adult-type GCTs. Mutant FOXL2 is a potential driver in the pathogenesis of adult-type GCTs.},

Cytogenetics and FISH have contributed to the stratification of AML patients into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable risk categories. However, until recently, the prognostic stratification and treatment decision for the intermediate risk category, mostly comprising AML patients with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML), has been difficult due to the scarce knowledge of the molecular alterations underlying this large AML subgroup (which accounts for about 50\% of all adult AML). During the past decade, the discovery of numerous mutations associated with CN-AML has resulted in significant advances in the AML field. Here, we review the biological characteristics of the most common mutations underlying CN-AML and outline their clinical impact in the following settings: (i) definition of new molecular leukemia entities in the WHO classification; (ii) risk stratification of CN-AML patients according to mutational profile; and (iii) monitoring of minimal residual disease by specific quantitative molecular assays.},

We developed a protocol to generate ultra-long reads (N50 {\textgreater} 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an additional 5× coverage of these ultra-long reads more than doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 ∼6.4 Mb). The final assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8\% of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8\%. Ultra-long reads enabled assembly and phasing of the 4-Mb major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus in its entirety, measurement of telomere repeat length, and closure of gaps in the reference human genome assembly GRCh38.},

Four specimen types were processed on three different microarray platforms—from Affymetrix, Agilent, and Illumina. Each microarray platform was employed at two independent test sites. The results were compared in a blinded manner with current standard methods, including karyotype, FISH, or morphology. Twenty-nine chronic lymphocytic leukemia blood, 34 myelodysplastic syndrome bone marrow, and 30 fresh frozen renal epithelial tumor samples were assessed by all six laboratories. Thirty formalin fixed paraffin embedded renal tumor samples were analyzed at the Affymetrix and Agilent test sites only. All study samples were initial diagnostic samples. Array data were analyzed at each participating site and were submitted to caArray for central analysis. Laboratory interpretive results were submitted to the central analysis team for comparison with the standard-of-care assays and for calculation of intraplatform reproducibility and cross-platform concordance. The results demonstrated that the three microarray platforms 1) detect clinically actionable genomic changes in cancer compatible to standard-of-care methods; 2) further define cytogenetic aberrations; 3) identify submicroscopic alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH); and 4) yield consistent results within and between laboratories.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2407-8-87},
	abstract = {Background
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality. The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous though a strong hereditary component has been identified. However, only a small proportion of the inherited susceptibility can be ascribed to dominant syndromes, such as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) or Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). In an attempt to identify novel colorectal cancer predisposing genes, we have performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in 30 Swedish non-FAP/non-HNPCC families with a strong family history of colorectal cancer.

Methods
Statistical analysis was performed using multipoint parametric and nonparametric linkage.

Results
Parametric analysis under the assumption of locus homogeneity excluded any common susceptibility regions harbouring a predisposing gene for colorectal cancer. However, several loci on chromosomes 2q, 3q, 6q, and 7q with suggestive linkage were detected in the parametric analysis under the assumption of locus heterogeneity as well as in the nonparametric analysis. Among these loci, the locus on chromosome 3q21.1-q26.2 was the most consistent finding providing positive results in both parametric and nonparametric analyses Heterogeneity LOD score (HLOD) = 1.90, alpha = 0.45, Non-Parametric LOD score (NPL) = 2.1).

Conclusion
The strongest evidence of linkage was seen for the region on chromosome 3. Interestingly, the same region has recently been reported as the most significant finding in a genome-wide analysis performed with SNP arrays; thus our results independently support the finding on chromosome 3q.},

	abstract = {Angelman syndrome (AS), characterized by mental retardation, seizures, frequent smiling and laughter, and abnormal gait, is one of the best examples of human disease in which genetic imprinting plays a role. In about 70\% of cases, AS is caused by de novo maternal deletions at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Approximately 2\% of AS cases are caused by paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 (ref. 3) and 2-3\% are caused by "imprinting mutations'. In the remaining 25\% of AS cases, no deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), or methylation abnormality is detectable, and these cases, unlike deletions or UPD, can be familial. These cases are likely to result from mutations in a gene that is expressed either exclusively or preferentially from the maternal chromosome 15. We have found that a 15q inversion inherited by an AS child from her normal mother disrupts the 5' end of the UBE3A (E6-AP) gene, the product of which functions in protein ubiquitination. We have looked for novel UBE3A mutations in nondeletion/non-UPD/non-imprinting mutation (NDUI) AS patients and have found one patient who is heterozygous for a 5-bp de novo tandem duplication. We have also found in two brothers a heterozygous mutation, an A to G transition that creates a new 3' splice junction 7 bp upstream from the normal splice junction. Both mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift and premature termination of translation. Our results demonstrate that UBE3A mutations are one cause of AS and indicate a possible abnormality in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during brain development in this disease.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The conventional approach to personalized medicine relies on molecular data analytics across multiple patients. The path to precision medicine lies with molecular data analytics that can discover interpretable single-subject signals (N-of-1). We developed a global framework, N-of-1-pathways, for a mechanistic-anchored approach to single-subject gene expression data analysis. We previously employed a metric that could prioritize the statistical significance of a deregulated pathway in single subjects, however, it lacked in quantitative interpretability (e.g. the equivalent to a gene expression fold-change).
RESULTS: In this study, we extend our previous approach with the application of statistical Mahalanobis distance (MD) to quantify personal pathway-level deregulation. We demonstrate that this approach, N-of-1-pathways Paired Samples MD (N-OF-1-PATHWAYS-MD), detects deregulated pathways (empirical simulations), while not inflating false-positive rate using a study with biological replicates. Finally, we establish that N-OF-1-PATHWAYS-MD scores are, biologically significant, clinically relevant and are predictive of breast cancer survival (P {\textless} 0.05, n = 80 invasive carcinoma; TCGA RNA-sequences).
CONCLUSION: N-of-1-pathways MD provides a practical approach towards precision medicine. The method generates the magnitude and the biological significance of personal deregulated pathways results derived solely from the patient's transcriptome. These pathways offer the opportunities for deriving clinically actionable decisions that have the potential to complement the clinical interpretability of personal polymorphisms obtained from DNA acquired or inherited polymorphisms and mutations. In addition, it offers an opportunity for applicability to diseases in which DNA changes may not be relevant, and thus expand the 'interpretable 'omics' of single subjects (e.g. personalome).

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btw248},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: As 'omics' biotechnologies accelerate the capability to contrast a myriad of molecular measurements from a single cell, they also exacerbate current analytical limitations for detecting meaningful single-cell dysregulations. Moreover, mRNA expression alone lacks functional interpretation, limiting opportunities for translation of single-cell transcriptomic insights to precision medicine. Lastly, most single-cell RNA-sequencing analytic approaches are not designed to investigate small populations of cells such as circulating tumor cells shed from solid tumors and isolated from patient blood samples.
RESULTS: In response to these characteristics and limitations in current single-cell RNA-sequencing methodology, we introduce an analytic framework that models transcriptome dynamics through the analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within biomolecular pathways. Cell-cell statistical distances are calculated from pathway mRNA fold changes between two cells. Within an elaborate case study of circulating tumor cells derived from prostate cancer patients, we develop analytic methods of aggregated distances to identify five differentially expressed pathways associated to therapeutic resistance. Our aggregation analyses perform comparably with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and better than differentially expressed genes followed by gene set enrichment. However, these methods were not designed to inform on differential pathway expression for a single cell. As such, our framework culminates with the novel aggregation method, cell-centric statistics (CCS). CCS quantifies the effect size and significance of differentially expressed pathways for a single cell of interest. Improved rose plots of differentially expressed pathways in each cell highlight the utility of CCS for therapeutic decision-making.

	abstract = {Background
Transcriptome analytic tools are commonly used across patient cohorts to develop drugs and predict clinical outcomes. However, as precision medicine pursues more accurate and individualized treatment decisions, these methods are not designed to address single-patient transcriptome analyses. We previously developed and validated the N-of-1-pathways framework using two methods, Wilcoxon and Mahalanobis Distance (MD), for personal transcriptome analysis derived from a pair of samples of a single patient. Although, both methods uncover concordantly dysregulated pathways, they are not designed to detect dysregulated pathways with up- and down-regulated genes (bidirectional dysregulation) that are ubiquitous in biological systems.

Results
We developed N-of-1-pathways MixEnrich, a mixture model followed by a gene set enrichment test, to uncover bidirectional and concordantly dysregulated pathways one patient at a time. We assess its accuracy in a comprehensive simulation study and in a RNA-Seq data analysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). In presence of bidirectionally dysregulated genes in the pathway or in presence of high background noise, MixEnrich substantially outperforms previous single-subject transcriptome analysis methods, both in the simulation study and the HNSCCs data analysis (ROC Curves; higher true positive rates; lower false positive rates). Bidirectional and concordant dysregulated pathways uncovered by MixEnrich in each patient largely overlapped with the quasi-gold standard compared to other single-subject and cohort-based transcriptome analyses.

Conclusion
The greater performance of MixEnrich presents an advantage over previous methods to meet the promise of providing accurate personal transcriptome analysis to support precision medicine at point of care.

	abstract = {We aim to provide clinically applicable, reproducible, mechanistic interpretations of gene expression changes that lack in gene overlap among predictive gene-signatures. Using a method we recently developed, Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME), we provide evidence that Gene Ontology-anchored signatures (GO-signatures) show reliable prognosis in lung cancer. In order to demonstrate the biological congruence and reproducibility of FAIME-derived mechanism classifiers, we chose a disease where gene expression classifiers signatures alone had failed to significantly stratify a larger collection of samples and that exhibited poor or no genetic overlap. For each patient in the two lung adenocarcinoma studies, personalized FAIME-profiles of GO biological processes are generated from genome-wide expression profiles. For both training studies, GO-signatures significantly associated to patient mortality were identified (Prediction Analysis for Microarrays; three-fold cross-validation). These two GO-signatures could effectively stratify patients from an independent validation cohort into sub-groups that show significant differences in disease-free survival (log-rank test P=0.019; P=0.001). Importantly, significant mechanism overlaps assessed by information-theory similarity were detected between the two GO-signatures (Fischer Exact Test p=0.001). Hence, together with machine learning technologies, FAIME could be utilized to develop an ontology-driven and expression-anchored prognostic signature that is personalized for an individual patient.},

	abstract = {Gene expression signatures that are predictive of therapeutic response or prognosis are increasingly useful in clinical care; however, mechanistic (and intuitive) interpretation of expression arrays remains an unmet challenge. Additionally, there is surprisingly little gene overlap among distinct clinically validated expression signatures. These "causality challenges" hinder the adoption of signatures as compared to functionally well-characterized single gene biomarkers. To increase the utility of multi-gene signatures in survival studies, we developed a novel approach to generate "personal mechanism signatures" of molecular pathways and functions from gene expression arrays. FAIME, the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression, computes mechanism scores using rank-weighted gene expression of an individual sample. By comparing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples with non-tumor control tissues, the precision and recall of deregulated FAIME-derived mechanisms of pathways and molecular functions are comparable to those produced by conventional cohort-wide methods (e.g. GSEA). The overlap of "Oncogenic FAIME Features of HNSCC" (statistically significant and differentially regulated FAIME-derived genesets representing GO functions or KEGG pathways derived from HNSCC tissue) among three distinct HNSCC datasets (pathways:46\%, p{\textless}0.001) is more significant than the gene overlap (genes:4\%). These Oncogenic FAIME Features of HNSCC can accurately discriminate tumors from control tissues in two additional HNSCC datasets (n = 35 and 91, F-accuracy = 100\% and 97\%, empirical p{\textless}0.001, area under the receiver operating characteristic curves = 99\% and 92\%), and stratify recurrence-free survival in patients from two independent studies (p = 0.0018 and p = 0.032, log-rank). Previous approaches depending on group assignment of individual samples before selecting features or learning a classifier are limited by design to discrete-class prediction. In contrast, FAIME calculates mechanism profiles for individual patients without requiring group assignment in validation sets. FAIME is more amenable for clinical deployment since it translates the gene-level measurements of each given sample into pathways and molecular function profiles that can be applied to analyze continuous phenotypes in clinical outcome studies (e.g. survival time, tumor volume).},

In this study, we assessed the additional predictive value of the 70-gene MammaPrint signature for chemotherapy (CT) benefit in addition to endocrine therapy (ET) from pooled study series. For 541 patients who received either ET (n = 315) or ET + CT (n = 226), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS) at 5 years were assessed separately for the 70-gene high and low risk groups. The 70-gene signature classified 252 patients (47\%) as low risk and 289 (53\%) as high risk. Within the 70-gene low risk group, BCSS was 97\% for the ET group and 99\% for the ET + CT group at 5 years with a non-significant univariate hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (95\% CI 0.07-4.98; P = 0.62). In the 70-gene high risk group, BCSS was 81\% (ET group) and 94\% (ET + CT group) at 5 years with a significant HR of 0.21 (95\% CI 0.07-0.59; P {\textless} 0.01). DDFS was 93\% (ET) versus 99\% (ET + CT), respectively, in the 70-gene low risk group, HR 0.26 (95\% CI 0.03-2.02; P = 0.20). In the high risk group DDFS was 76 versus 88\%, HR of 0.35 (95\% CI 0.17-0.71; P {\textless} 0.01). Results were similar in multivariate analysis, showing significant survival benefit by adding CT in the 70-gene high risk group. A significant and clinically meaningful benefit was observed by adding chemotherapy to endocrine treatment in 70-gene high risk patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Granulosa-cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common type of malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor (SCST). The pathogenesis of these tumors is unknown. Moreover, their histopathological diagnosis can be challenging, and there is no curative treatment beyond surgery.
METHODS: We analyzed four adult-type GCTs using whole-transcriptome paired-end RNA sequencing. We identified putative GCT-specific mutations that were present in at least three of these samples but were absent from the transcriptomes of 11 epithelial ovarian tumors, published human genomes, and databases of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We confirmed these variants by direct sequencing of complementary DNA and genomic DNA. We then analyzed additional tumors and matched normal genomic DNA, using a combination of direct sequencing, analyses of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms, and TaqMan assays.
RESULTS: All four index GCTs had a missense point mutation, 402C--{\textgreater}G (C134W), in FOXL2, a gene encoding a transcription factor known to be critical for granulosa-cell development. The FOXL2 mutation was present in 86 of 89 additional adult-type GCTs (97\%), in 3 of 14 thecomas (21\%), and in 1 of 10 juvenile-type GCTs (10\%). The mutation was absent in 49 SCSTs of other types and in 329 unrelated ovarian or breast tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Whole-transcriptome sequencing of four GCTs identified a single, recurrent somatic mutation (402C--{\textgreater}G) in FOXL2 that was present in almost all morphologically identified adult-type GCTs. Mutant FOXL2 is a potential driver in the pathogenesis of adult-type GCTs.},

	abstract = {C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) are two of the most commonly used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research. However, the only currently available mouse genome is based entirely on the B6 strain sequence. Subsequently, oligonucleotide microarray probes are based solely on this B6 reference sequence, making their application for gene expression profiling comparisons across mouse strains dubious due to their allelic sequence differences, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the RNA-Seq application provides a clear alternative to oligonucleotide arrays for detecting differential gene expression without the problems inherent to hybridization-based technologies. Using RNA-Seq, an average of 22 million short sequencing reads were generated per sample for 21 samples (10 B6 and 11 D2), and these reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome, allowing 16,183 Ensembl genes to be queried in striatum for both strains. To determine differential expression, ‘digital mRNA counting’ is applied based on reads that map to exons. The current study compares RNA-Seq (Illumina GA IIx) with two microarray platforms (Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 and Affymetrix MOE 430 2.0) to detect differential striatal gene expression between the B6 and D2 inbred mouse strains. We show that by using stringent data processing requirements differential expression as determined by RNA-Seq is concordant with both the Affymetrix and Illumina platforms in more instances than it is concordant with only a single platform, and that instances of discordance with respect to direction of fold change were rare. Finally, we show that additional information is gained from RNA-Seq compared to hybridization-based techniques as RNA-Seq detects more genes than either microarray platform. The majority of genes differentially expressed in RNA-Seq were only detected as present in RNA-Seq, which is important for studies with smaller effect sizes where the sensitivity of hybridization-based techniques could bias interpretation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with breast cancer who have no involved lymph nodes and estrogen-receptor-positive tumors is poorly defined by clinical and histopathological measures.
METHODS: We tested whether the results of a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 21 prospectively selected genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue would correlate with the likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with node-negative, tamoxifen-treated breast cancer who were enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project clinical trial B-14. The levels of expression of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes were used in a prospectively defined algorithm to calculate a recurrence score and to determine a risk group (low, intermediate, or high) for each patient.
RESULTS: Adequate RT-PCR profiles were obtained in 668 of 675 tumor blocks. The proportions of patients categorized as having a low, intermediate, or high risk by the RT-PCR assay were 51, 22, and 27 percent, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates of distant recurrence at 10 years in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 6.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 9.6), 14.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8.3 to 20.3), and 30.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23.6 to 37.4). The rate in the low-risk group was significantly lower than that in the high-risk group (P{\textless}0.001). In a multivariate Cox model, the recurrence score provided significant predictive power that was independent of age and tumor size (P{\textless}0.001). The recurrence score was also predictive of overall survival (P{\textless}0.001) and could be used as a continuous function to predict distant recurrence in individual patients.

Furthermore, protocols for the analysis and interpretation of NGS data, as well as knowledge bases, are being amassed, allowing clinicians to act more easily on genomic information at the point of care for patients. In parallel, new therapies that target somatically mutated genes identified through clinical NGS are gaining US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, and novel clinical trial designs are emerging in which genetic identifiers are given equal weight to histology.

Cytogenetics and FISH have contributed to the stratification of AML patients into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable risk categories. However, until recently, the prognostic stratification and treatment decision for the intermediate risk category, mostly comprising AML patients with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML), has been difficult due to the scarce knowledge of the molecular alterations underlying this large AML subgroup (which accounts for about 50\% of all adult AML). During the past decade, the discovery of numerous mutations associated with CN-AML has resulted in significant advances in the AML field. Here, we review the biological characteristics of the most common mutations underlying CN-AML and outline their clinical impact in the following settings: (i) definition of new molecular leukemia entities in the WHO classification; (ii) risk stratification of CN-AML patients according to mutational profile; and (iii) monitoring of minimal residual disease by specific quantitative molecular assays.},

We developed a protocol to generate ultra-long reads (N50 {\textgreater} 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an additional 5× coverage of these ultra-long reads more than doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 ∼6.4 Mb). The final assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8\% of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8\%.

	abstract = {Cytogenomic microarray analysis (CMA) offers high resolution, genome-wide copy number information and is widely used in clinical laboratories for diagnosis of constitutional abnormalities. The Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC) conducted a multiplatform, multicenter clinical validation project to compare the reliability and inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility of this technology for clinical oncology applications. Four specimen types were processed on three different microarray platforms—from Affymetrix, Agilent, and Illumina. Each microarray platform was employed at two independent test sites. The results were compared in a blinded manner with current standard methods, including karyotype, FISH, or morphology. Twenty-nine chronic lymphocytic leukemia blood, 34 myelodysplastic syndrome bone marrow, and 30 fresh frozen renal epithelial tumor samples were assessed by all six laboratories. Thirty formalin fixed paraffin embedded renal tumor samples were analyzed at the Affymetrix and Agilent test sites only. All study samples were initial diagnostic samples. Array data were analyzed at each participating site and were submitted to caArray for central analysis. Laboratory interpretive results were submitted to the central analysis team for comparison with the standard-of-care assays and for calculation of intraplatform reproducibility and cross-platform concordance. The results demonstrated that the three microarray platforms 1) detect clinically actionable genomic changes in cancer compatible to standard-of-care methods; 2) further define cytogenetic aberrations; 3) identify submicroscopic alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH); and 4) yield consistent results within and between laboratories. Based on this study, the CGC concludes that CMA is a sensitive and reliable technique for copy number and LOH assessment that may be used for clinical oncology genomic analysis.},

	abstract = {Background
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality. The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous though a strong hereditary component has been identified. However, only a small proportion of the inherited susceptibility can be ascribed to dominant syndromes, such as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) or Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). In an attempt to identify novel colorectal cancer predisposing genes, we have performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in 30 Swedish non-FAP/non-HNPCC families with a strong family history of colorectal cancer.

Methods
Statistical analysis was performed using multipoint parametric and nonparametric linkage.

Results
Parametric analysis under the assumption of locus homogeneity excluded any common susceptibility regions harbouring a predisposing gene for colorectal cancer. However, several loci on chromosomes 2q, 3q, 6q, and 7q with suggestive linkage were detected in the parametric analysis under the assumption of locus heterogeneity as well as in the nonparametric analysis. Among these loci, the locus on chromosome 3q21.1-q26.2 was the most consistent finding providing positive results in both parametric and nonparametric analyses Heterogeneity LOD score (HLOD) = 1.90, alpha = 0.45, Non-Parametric LOD score (NPL) = 2.1).

Conclusion
The strongest evidence of linkage was seen for the region on chromosome 3. Interestingly, the same region has recently been reported as the most significant finding in a genome-wide analysis performed with SNP arrays; thus our results independently support the finding on chromosome 3q.},

	abstract = {Angelman syndrome (AS), characterized by mental retardation, seizures, frequent smiling and laughter, and abnormal gait, is one of the best examples of human disease in which genetic imprinting plays a role. In about 70\% of cases, AS is caused by de novo maternal deletions at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Approximately 2\% of AS cases are caused by paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 (ref. 3) and 2-3\% are caused by "imprinting mutations'. In the remaining 25\% of AS cases, no deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), or methylation abnormality is detectable, and these cases, unlike deletions or UPD, can be familial. These cases are likely to result from mutations in a gene that is expressed either exclusively or preferentially from the maternal chromosome 15. We have found that a 15q inversion inherited by an AS child from her normal mother disrupts the 5' end of the UBE3A (E6-AP) gene, the product of which functions in protein ubiquitination. We have looked for novel UBE3A mutations in nondeletion/non-UPD/non-imprinting mutation (NDUI) AS patients and have found one patient who is heterozygous for a 5-bp de novo tandem duplication. We have also found in two brothers a heterozygous mutation, an A to G transition that creates a new 3' splice junction 7 bp upstream from the normal splice junction. Both mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift and premature termination of translation. Our results demonstrate that UBE3A mutations are one cause of AS and indicate a possible abnormality in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during brain development in this disease.},

In contrast to typical drug development strategies aimed at targets that are highly conserved among individual patients, treatment at the genomic level must contend with substantial inter-individual natural genetic variation. Here we analyze the recently released ExAC and 1000 Genomes data sets to determine how human genetic variation impacts target choice for Cas endonucleases in the context of therapeutic genome editing. We find that this genetic variation confounds the target sites of certain Cas endonucleases more than others, and we provide a compendium of guide RNAs predicted to have high efficacy in diverse patient populations. For further analysis, we focus on 12 therapeutically relevant genes and consider how genetic variation affects off-target candidates for these loci. Our analysis suggests that, in large populations of individuals, most candidate off-target sites will be rare, underscoring the need for prescreening of patients through whole-genome sequencing to ensure safety. This information can be integrated with empirical methods for guide RNA selection into a framework for designing CRISPR-based therapeutics that maximizes efficacy and safety across patient populations.},

Since genetic information has become increasingly important to explore the biological mechanisms of cognitive decline, the search for genetic biomarkers of cognitive aging has received much attention. There is growing evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the ADAMTS9, BDNF, CASS4, COMT, CR1, DNMT3A, DTNBP1, REST, SRR, TOMM40, circadian clock, and Alzheimer’s diseases-associated genes may contribute to susceptibility to cognitive aging. In this review, we first illustrated evidence of the genetic contribution to disease susceptibility to age-related cognitive decline in recent studies ranging from approaches of candidate genes to genome-wide association studies. We then surveyed a variety of association studies regarding age-related cognitive decline with consideration of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Finally, we highlighted their limitations and future directions. In light of advances in precision medicine and multi-omics technologies, future research in genomic medicine promises to lead to innovative ideas that are relevant to disease prevention and novel drugs for cognitive aging.},

Epidemiological evidence as well as twin studies points towards a genetic component contributing to aetiology.Sources of dataKey recently published literature.Areas of agreementA family history of PrCa doubles the risk of disease development in first-degree relatives. Linkage and genetic sequencing studies identified rare moderate–high-risk gene loci, which predispose to PrCa development when altered by mutation. Genome-wide association studies have identified common single-nucleotide polypmorphisms (SNPs), which confer a cumulative risk of PrCa development with increasing number of risk alleles. There are emerging data that castrate-resistant disease is associated with mutations in DNA repair genes.Areas of controversyLinkage studies investigating possible high-risk loci leading to PrCa development identified possible loci on several chromosomes, but most have not been consistently replicated by subsequent studies. Germline SNPs related to prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and to normal tissue radiosensitivity have also been identified though not all have been validated in subsequent studies.Growing pointsUtilizing germline SNP profiles as well as identifying high-risk genetic variants could target screening to high-risk groups, avoiding the drawbacks of PSA screening.Areas timely for developing researchIncorporating genetics into PrCa screening is being investigated currently using both common SNP profiles and higher risk rare variants. Knowledge of germline genetic defects will allow the development of targeted screening programs, preventive strategies and the personalized treatment of PrCa.},

	abstract = {In the UK, women are invited for 3-yearly mammography screening, through the NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP), from the ages of 47–50 years to the ages of 69–73 years. Women with family histories of breast cancer can, from the age of 40 years, obtain enhanced surveillance and, in exceptionally high-risk cases, magnetic resonance imaging. However, no NHSBSP risk assessment is undertaken. Risk prediction models are able to categorise women by risk using known risk factors, although accurate individual risk prediction remains elusive. The identification of mammographic breast density (MD) and common genetic risk variants [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] has presaged the improved precision of risk models., To (1) identify the best performing model to assess breast cancer risk in family history clinic (FHC) and population settings; (2) use information from MD/SNPs to improve risk prediction; (3) assess the acceptability and feasibility of offering risk assessment in the NHSBSP; and (4) identify the incremental costs and benefits of risk stratified screening in a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis., Two cohort studies assessing breast cancer incidence., High-risk FHC and the NHSBSP Greater Manchester, UK., A total of 10,000 women aged 20–79 years [Family History Risk Study (FH-Risk); UK Clinical Research Network identification number (UKCRN-ID) 8611] and 53,000 women from the NHSBSP [aged 46–73 years; Predicting the Risk of Cancer At Screening (PROCAS) study; UKCRN-ID 8080]., Questionnaires collected standard risk information, and mammograms were assessed for breast density by a number of techniques. All FH-Risk and 10,000 PROCAS participants participated in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) studies. The risk prediction models Manual method, Tyrer–Cuzick (TC), BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm) and Gail were used to assess risk, with modelling based on MD and SNPs. A preliminary model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of risk stratified screening was conducted., Breast cancer incidence., The NHSBSP; cancer registration., A total of 446 women developed incident breast cancers in FH-Risk in 97,958 years of follow-up. All risk models accurately stratified women into risk categories. TC had better risk precision than Gail, and BOADICEA accurately predicted risk in the 6268 single probands. The Manual model was also accurate in the whole cohort. In PROCAS, TC had better risk precision than Gail [area under the curve (AUC) 0.58 vs. 0.54], identifying 547 prospective breast cancers. The addition of SNPs in the FH-Risk case–control study improved risk precision but was not useful in BRCA1 (breast cancer 1 gene) families. Risk modelling of SNPs in PROCAS showed an incremental improvement from using SNP18 used in PROCAS to SNP67. MD measured by visual assessment score provided better risk stratification than automatic measures, despite wide intra- and inter-reader variability. Using a MD-adjusted TC model in PROCAS improved risk stratification (AUC = 0.6) and identified significantly higher rates (4.7 per 10,000 vs. 1.3 per 10,000; p {\textless} 0.001) of high-stage cancers in women with above-average breast cancer risks. It is not possible to provide estimates of the incremental costs and benefits of risk stratified screening because of lack of data inputs for key parameters in the model-based cost-effectiveness analysis., Risk precision can be improved by using DNA and MD, and can potentially be used to stratify NHSBSP screening. It may also identify those at greater risk of high-stage cancers for enhanced screening. The cost-effectiveness of risk stratified screening is currently associated with extensive uncertainty. Additional research is needed to identify data needed for key inputs into model-based cost-effectiveness analyses to identify the impact on health-care resource use and patient benefits., A pilot of real-time NHSBSP risk prediction to identify women for chemoprevention and enhanced screening is required., The National Institute for Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme.

	abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) reflects the dominant consequences of a CAG-repeat expansion in HTT. Analysis of common SNP-based haplotypes has revealed that most European HD subjects have distinguishable HTT haplotypes on their normal and disease chromosomes and that ∼50\% of the latter share the same major HD haplotype. We reasoned that sequence-level investigation of this founder haplotype could provide significant insights into the history of HD and valuable information for gene-targeting approaches. Consequently, we performed whole-genome sequencing of HD and control subjects from four independent families in whom the major European HD haplotype segregates with the disease. Analysis of the full-sequence-based HTT haplotype indicated that these four families share a common ancestor sufficiently distant to have permitted the accumulation of family-specific variants. Confirmation of new CAG-expansion mutations on this haplotype suggests that unlike most founders of human disease, the common ancestor of HD-affected families with the major haplotype most likely did not have HD. Further, availability of the full sequence data validated the use of SNP imputation to predict the optimal variants for capturing heterozygosity in personalized allele-specific gene-silencing approaches. As few as ten SNPs are capable of revealing heterozygosity in more than 97\% of European HD subjects. Extension of allele-specific silencing strategies to the few remaining homozygous individuals is likely to be achievable through additional known SNPs and discovery of private variants by complete sequencing of HTT. These data suggest that the current development of gene-based targeting for HD could be extended to personalized allele-specific approaches in essentially all HD individuals of European ancestry.},

Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis with the mutation allow for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT transcript as a therapeutic strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise heterozygosity estimates are needed across diverse HD patient populations. Here we present the first comprehensive investigation of all common target alleles across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives in Canada, Sweden, France, and Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and A3a) define mutually exclusive sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy in the greatest number of patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80\% are treatable using these three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion found exclusively on the A1 haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of mutant HTT in approximately 40\% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the deletion reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78\% in patient cells while sparing wild-type HTT expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG occurs, we demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific therapy for a monogenic disorder.},

In specific diseases, selective silencing of only one copy of a gene may be advantageous over non-selective silencing of both copies. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Silencing both expanded and normal copies of HTT may be therapeutically beneficial, but preservation of normal HTT expression is preferred. Allele-specific methods can selectively silence the mutant HTT transcript by targeting either the expanded CAG repeat or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with the expansion. Both approaches require personalized treatment strategies based on patient genotypes. We compare the prospect of safe treatment of HD by CAG- and SNP-specific silencing approaches and review HD population genetics used to guide target identification in the patient population. Clinical implementation of allele-specific HTT silencing faces challenges common to personalized genetic medicine, requiring novel solutions from clinical scientists and regulatory authorities.},

	abstract = {The emergence of personalized medicine mandates a complete understating of DNA sequence variation that modulates drug response. Initial forays have been made in the cardiac arena, yet much remains to be elucidated in the pharmacogenetics of cardiac drugs. Most progress has been made in describing DNA sequence variation related to the anticoagulant warfarin and the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel. This includes a description of DNA sequence variation that underlies pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability, the impact of such variation on predicting hard outcomes, and the ability of genotype-guided prescription to facilitate rapid titration to a therapeutic range while avoiding unnecessary high plasma levels. Nuanced prescription will require a complete inventory of DNA sequence variants that underlie drug-related side effects.},

	abstract = {The SNCA intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs356168, has been associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in large genome wide association studies (GWAS). Recently, the PD-risk allele, rs356168-G was shown to increase SNCA-mRNA expression using genome edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons. In this study, as means of validation, we tested the effect of rs356168 on total SNCA-mRNA levels using brain tissues, temporal and frontal cortex, from healthy control donors. Carriers of the rs356168-G allele demonstrated a borderline significant decrease of SNCA-mRNA levels in temporal brain tissues (p=0.02) compared to individuals homozygous for the ‘A’ allele. Similar trend, but weak, was observed in the analysis of frontal cortex samples, however, this analysis did not reach statistical significance. These results conflict with the recently reported effect of SNCA SNP rs356168 described above. Our study conveys the need to carefully interpret the precise molecular mechanism by which rs356168, or another tightly linked variant, affects the regulation of SNCA expression. The regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the observed associations between PD and the SNCA-3’ linkage disequilibrium (LD) region warrant further investigations.},

Using genomic, clinical, environmental, and behavioral data, tracking and management of individual wellness is possible. A prolific way to carry this personalized approach into routine practices can be accomplished by integrating clinical interpretations of genomic variations into electronic medical records (EMRs)/electronic health records (EHRs). Today, various central EHR infrastructures have been constituted in many countries of the world including Turkey. Objective: The objective of this study was to concentrate on incorporating the personal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data into the National Health Information System of Turkey (NHIS-T) for disease risk assessment, and evaluate the performance of various predictive models for prostate cancer cases. We present our work as a miniseries containing three parts: (1) an overview of requirements, (2) the incorporation of SNP into the NHIS-T, and (3) an evaluation of SNP incorporated NHIS-T for prostate cancer. Methods: For the first article of this miniseries, the scientific literature is reviewed and the requirements of SNP data integration into EMRs/EHRs are extracted and presented. Results: In the literature, basic requirements of genomic-enabled EMRs/EHRs are listed as incorporating genotype data and its clinical interpretation into EMRs/EHRs, developing accurate and accessible clinicogenomic interpretation resources (knowledge bases), interpreting and reinterpreting of variant data, and immersing of clinicogenomic information into the medical decision processes. In this section, we have analyzed these requirements under the subtitles of terminology standards, interoperability standards, clinicogenomic knowledge bases, defining clinical significance, and clinicogenomic decision support. Conclusions: In order to integrate structured genotype and phenotype data into any system, there is a need to determine data components, terminology standards, and identifiers of clinicogenomic information. Also, we need to determine interoperability standards to share information between different information systems of stakeholders, and develop decision support capability to interpret genomic variations based on the knowledge bases via different assessment approaches.

	abstract = {Objective To compare three groupings of Electronic Health Record (EHR) billing codes for their ability to represent clinically meaningful phenotypes and to replicate known genetic associations. The three tested coding systems were the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification Software for ICD-9-CM (CCS), and manually curated “phecodes” designed to facilitate phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) in EHRs.   Methods and materials We selected 100 disease phenotypes and compared the ability of each coding system to accurately represent them without performing additional groupings. The 100 phenotypes included 25 randomly-chosen clinical phenotypes pursued in prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and another 75 common disease phenotypes mentioned across free-text problem lists from 189,289 individuals. We then evaluated the performance of each coding system to replicate known associations for 440 SNP-phenotype pairs.   Results Out of the 100 tested clinical phenotypes, phecodes exactly matched 83, compared to 53 for ICD-9-CM and 32 for CCS. ICD-9-CM codes were typically too detailed (requiring custom groupings) while CCS codes were often not granular enough. Among 440 tested known SNP-phenotype associations, use of phecodes replicated 153 SNP-phenotype pairs compared to 143 for ICD-9-CM and 139 for CCS. Phecodes also generally produced stronger odds ratios and lower p-values for known associations than ICD-9-CM and CCS. Finally, evaluation of several SNPs via PheWAS identified novel potential signals, some seen in only using the phecode approach. Among them, rs7318369 in PEPD was associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage.   Conclusion Our results suggest that the phecode groupings better align with clinical diseases mentioned in clinical practice or for genomic studies. ICD-9-CM, CCS, and phecode groupings all worked for PheWAS-type studies, though the phecode groupings produced superior results.},

	abstract = {A variety of health-related data are commonly deposited into electronic health records (EHRs), including laboratory, diagnostic, and medication information. The digital nature of EHR data facilitates efficient extraction of these data for research studies, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Previous GWAS have identified numerous SNPs associated with variation in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG). These findings have led to the development of specialized genotyping platforms that can be used for fine-mapping and replication in other populations. We have combined the efficiency of EHR data and the economic advantages of the Illumina Metabochip, a custom designed SNP chip targeted to traits related to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes, to conduct a GWAS for lipid traits in a population with extreme obesity. Our genome wide analysis identified association of SNPs residing at previously lipid associated loci with all lipid phenotypes, as well as 14 of 24 previously identified lipid-associated SNPs, although for a number of known lipid SNPs and body weight SNPs no association was found. Association analysis using several approaches to adjust for use of lipid lowering medications resulted in fewer and less strongly associated SNPs. The availability of phenotype data from the EHR and the economic efficiency of the specialized Metabochip can be exploited to conduct multi-faceted analyses for GWAS. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼},

Today, various central EHR infrastructures have been constituted in many countries of the world, including Turkey.

Objective
As an initial attempt to develop a sophisticated infrastructure, we have concentrated on incorporating the personal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data into the National Health Information System of Turkey (NHIS-T) for disease risk assessment, and evaluated the performance of various predictive models for prostate cancer cases. We present our work as a three part miniseries: (1) an overview of requirements, (2) the incorporation of SNP data into the NHIS-T, and (3) an evaluation of SNP data incorporated into the NHIS-T for prostate cancer.

Methods
In the third article of this miniseries, we have evaluated the proposed complementary capabilities (ie, knowledge base and end-user application) with real data. Before the evaluation phase, clinicogenomic associations about increased prostate cancer risk were extracted from knowledge sources, and published predictive genomic models assessing individual prostate cancer risk were collected. To evaluate complementary capabilities, we also gathered personal SNP data of four prostate cancer cases and fifteen controls. Using these data files, we compared various independent and model-based, prostate cancer risk assessment approaches.

Results
Through the extraction and selection processes of SNP-prostate cancer risk associations, we collected 209 independent associations for increased risk of prostate cancer from the studied knowledge sources. Also, we gathered six cumulative models and two probabilistic models. Cumulative models and assessment of independent associations did not have impressive results. There was one of the probabilistic, model-based interpretation that was successful compared to the others. In envirobehavioral and clinical evaluations, we found that some of the comorbidities, especially, would be useful to evaluate disease risk. Even though we had a very limited dataset, a comparison of performances of different disease models and their implementation with real data as use case scenarios helped us to gain deeper insight into the proposed architecture.

Conclusions
In order to benefit from genomic variation data, existing EHR/EMR systems must be constructed with the capability of tracking and monitoring all aspects of personal health status (genomic, clinical, environmental, etc) in 24/7 situations, and also with the capability of suggesting evidence-based recommendations. A national-level, accredited knowledge base is a top requirement for improved end-user systems interpreting these parameters. Finally, categorization using similar, individual characteristics (SNP patterns, exposure history, etc) may be an effective way to predict disease risks, but this approach needs to be concretized and supported with new studies.},

Although opioid sensitivity is well known to vary widely among individual subjects, several candidate genetic polymorphisms reported so far are not sufficient for fully understanding the wide range of interindividual differences in human opioid sensitivity. By conducting a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in healthy subjects, we found that genetic polymorphisms within a linkage disequilibrium block that spans 2q33.3–2q34 were strongly associated with the requirements for postoperative opioid analgesics after painful cosmetic surgery. The C allele of the best candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2952768, was associated with more analgesic requirements, and consistent results were obtained in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. In addition, carriers of the C allele in this SNP exhibited less vulnerability to severe drug dependence in patients with methamphetamine dependence, alcohol dependence, and eating disorders and a lower ‘Reward Dependence' score on a personality questionnaire in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the C/C genotype of this SNP was significantly associated with the elevated expression of a neighboring gene, CREB1. These results show that SNPs in this locus are the most potent genetic factors associated with human opioid sensitivity known to date, affecting both the efficacy of opioid analgesics and liability to severe substance dependence.

Background

Smoking cessation therapies are not effective for all smokers, and researchers are interested in identifying those subgroups of individuals (e.g. based on genotype) who respond best to specific treatments.

Objectives
Objectives

To assess whether quit rates vary by genetically informed biomarkers within pharmacotherapy treatment arms and as compared with placebo. To assess the effects of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation in subgroups of smokers defined by genotype for identified genome-wide significant polymorphisms.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register, clinical trial registries, and genetics databases for trials of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation from inception until 16 August 2016.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited adult smokers and reported pharmacogenomic analyses from trials of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies versus controls. Eligible trials included those with data on a priori genome-wide significant (P {\textless} 5 × 10-8) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), replicated non-SNPs, and/or the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), hereafter collectively described as biomarkers.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence at six months after treatment. The secondary outcome was abstinence at end of treatment (EOT). We conducted two types of meta-analyses- one in which we assessed smoking cessation of active treatment versus placebo within genotype groups, and another in which we compared smoking cessation across genotype groups within treatment arms. We carried out analyses separately in non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs). We assessed heterogeneity between genotype groups using T², I², and Cochrane Q statistics.

Main results
Main results

Analyses included 18 trials including 9017 participants, of whom 6924 were NHW and 2093 NHB participants. Data were available for the following biomarkers: nine SNPs (rs1051730 (CHRNA3); rs16969968, rs588765, and rs2036527 (CHRNA5); rs3733829 and rs7937 (in EGLN2, near CYP2A6); rs1329650 and rs1028936 (LOC100188947); and rs215605 (PDE1C)), two variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs; DRD4 and SLC6A4), and the NMR. Included data produced a total of 40 active versus placebo comparisons, 16 active versus active comparisons, and 64 between-genotype comparisons within treatment arms.
For those meta-analyses showing statistically significant heterogeneity between genotype groups, we found the quality of evidence (GRADE) to be generally moderate. We downgraded quality most often because of imprecision or risk of bias due to potential selection bias in genotyping trial participants.

Comparisons of relative treatment effects by genotype
For six-month abstinence, we found statistically significant heterogeneity between genotypes (rs16969968) for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo at six months for NHB participants (P = 0.03; n = 2 trials), but not for other biomarkers or treatment comparisons. Six-month abstinence was increased in the active NRT group as compared to placebo among participants with a GG genotype (risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.03), but not in the combined group of participants with a GA or AA genotype (RR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.15 to 1.26; ratio of risk ratios (RRR) GG vs GA or AA of 3.51, 95\% CI 1.19 to 10.3).

Comparisons of treatment effects between genotype groups within pharmacotherapy randomisation arms
For those receiving active NRT, treatment was more effective in achieving six-month abstinence among individuals with a slow NMR than among those with a normal NMR among NHW and NHB combined participants (normal NMR vs slow NMR: RR 0.54, 95\% CI 0.37 to 0.78; n = 2 trials). We found no such differences in treatment effects between genotypes at six months for any of the other biomarkers among individuals who received pharmacotherapy or placebo.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

We did not identify widespread differential treatment effects of pharmacotherapy based on genotype. Some genotype groups within certain ethnic groups may benefit more from NRT or may benefit less from the combination of bupropion with NRT. The reader should interpret these results with caution because none of the statistically significant meta-analyses included more than two trials per genotype comparison, many confidence intervals were wide, and the quality of this evidence (GRADE) was generally moderate. Although we found evidence of superior NRT efficacy for NMR slow versus normal metabolisers, because of the lack of heterogeneity between NMR groups, we cannot conclude that NRT is more effective for slow metabolisers. Access to additional data from multiple trials is needed, particularly for comparisons of different pharmacotherapies.},

Background

Smoking cessation therapies are not effective for all smokers, and researchers are interested in identifying those subgroups of individuals (e.g. based on genotype) who respond best to specific treatments.

Objectives
Objectives

To assess whether quit rates vary by genetically informed biomarkers within pharmacotherapy treatment arms and as compared with placebo. To assess the effects of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation in subgroups of smokers defined by genotype for identified genome-wide significant polymorphisms.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register, clinical trial registries, and genetics databases for trials of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation from inception until 16 August 2016.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited adult smokers and reported pharmacogenomic analyses from trials of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies versus controls. Eligible trials included those with data on a priori genome-wide significant (P {\textless} 5 × 10-8) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), replicated non-SNPs, and/or the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), hereafter collectively described as biomarkers.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence at six months after treatment. The secondary outcome was abstinence at end of treatment (EOT). We conducted two types of meta-analyses- one in which we assessed smoking cessation of active treatment versus placebo within genotype groups, and another in which we compared smoking cessation across genotype groups within treatment arms. We carried out analyses separately in non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs). We assessed heterogeneity between genotype groups using T², I², and Cochrane Q statistics.

Main results
Main results

Analyses included 18 trials including 9017 participants, of whom 6924 were NHW and 2093 NHB participants. Data were available for the following biomarkers: nine SNPs (rs1051730 (CHRNA3); rs16969968, rs588765, and rs2036527 (CHRNA5); rs3733829 and rs7937 (in EGLN2, near CYP2A6); rs1329650 and rs1028936 (LOC100188947); and rs215605 (PDE1C)), two variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs; DRD4 and SLC6A4), and the NMR. Included data produced a total of 40 active versus placebo comparisons, 16 active versus active comparisons, and 64 between-genotype comparisons within treatment arms.
For those meta-analyses showing statistically significant heterogeneity between genotype groups, we found the quality of evidence (GRADE) to be generally moderate. We downgraded quality most often because of imprecision or risk of bias due to potential selection bias in genotyping trial participants.

Comparisons of relative treatment effects by genotype
For six-month abstinence, we found statistically significant heterogeneity between genotypes (rs16969968) for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo at six months for NHB participants (P = 0.03; n = 2 trials), but not for other biomarkers or treatment comparisons. Six-month abstinence was increased in the active NRT group as compared to placebo among participants with a GG genotype (risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.03), but not in the combined group of participants with a GA or AA genotype (RR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.15 to 1.26; ratio of risk ratios (RRR) GG vs GA or AA of 3.51, 95\% CI 1.19 to 10.3).

Comparisons of treatment effects between genotype groups within pharmacotherapy randomisation arms
For those receiving active NRT, treatment was more effective in achieving six-month abstinence among individuals with a slow NMR than among those with a normal NMR among NHW and NHB combined participants (normal NMR vs slow NMR: RR 0.54, 95\% CI 0.37 to 0.78; n = 2 trials). We found no such differences in treatment effects between genotypes at six months for any of the other biomarkers among individuals who received pharmacotherapy or placebo.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

We did not identify widespread differential treatment effects of pharmacotherapy based on genotype. Some genotype groups within certain ethnic groups may benefit more from NRT or may benefit less from the combination of bupropion with NRT. The reader should interpret these results with caution because none of the statistically significant meta-analyses included more than two trials per genotype comparison, many confidence intervals were wide, and the quality of this evidence (GRADE) was generally moderate. Although we found evidence of superior NRT efficacy for NMR slow versus normal metabolisers, because of the lack of heterogeneity between NMR groups, we cannot conclude that NRT is more effective for slow metabolisers. Access to additional data from multiple trials is needed, particularly for comparisons of different pharmacotherapies.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is an often devastating neuropsychiatric illness. Understanding the genetic variation affecting response to antipsychotics is important to develop novel diagnostic tests to match individual schizophrenic patients to the most effective and safe medication. Here we use a genomewide approach to detect genetic variation underlying individual differences in response to treatment with the antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and perphenazine. Our sample consisted of 738 subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia who took part in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). Subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500K genotyping platform plus a custom 164K chip to improve genomewide coverage. Treatment outcome was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Our criterion for genomewide significance was a pre-specified threshold that ensures, on average, only 10\% of the significant findings are false discoveries. The top statistical result reached significance at our pre-specified threshold and involved a SNP in an intergenic region on chromosome 4p15. In addition, SNPs in ANKS1B and CNTNAP5 that mediated the effects of olanzapine and risperidone on Negative symptoms were very close to our threshold for declaring significance. The most significant SNP in CNTNAP5 is nonsynonymous, giving rise to an amino acid substitution. In addition to highlighting our top results, we provide all p-values for download as a resource for investigators with the requisite samples to carry out replication. This study demonstrates the potential of GWAS to discover novel genes that mediate effects of antipsychotics, which eventually could help to tailor drug treatment to schizophrenic patients.},

RNA-seq has been instrumental in improving the diagnostic classification of brain tumors, characterizing oncogenic fusion genes, and shedding light on intratumor heterogeneity. Currently, RNA-seq is beginning to be incorporated into regular neuro-oncology practice in the form of precision neuro-oncology programs, which use information from tumor sequencing to guide implementation of personalized targeted therapies. These programs show great promise in improving patient outcomes for tumors where single agent trials have been ineffective.

While most of these biomarkers are proteins, very few belong to the RNA family due to methodological constraints inherent to the assessment of RNAs. Over the past decade, technological developments have overcome these constraints and have allowed the assessment of RNAs in blood cells. Thus, the search for novel cardiovascular biomarkers among RNAs expressed in blood cells has emerged. This review highlights the potential of the transcriptome of blood cells to be used as a reservoir of novel cardiovascular biomarkers. First, the benefit of using biomarkers for personalized medicine is introduced. The focus is on the RNA family of biomarkers, both coding and non-coding. The value of systems-based approaches for biomarker discovery is discussed. Then, the current knowledge of the use of blood cells' transcriptome for biomarker discovery is reviewed. Recent technological developments that have facilitated the study of the transcriptome of blood cells are presented. Further axes of developments are proposed to bring RNA-based biomarkers to clinical application. Lastly, some directions for future work are presented.},

	abstract = {Importance
Understanding molecular mechanisms of response and resistance to anticancer therapies requires prospective patient follow-up and clinical and functional validation of both common and low-frequency mutations. We describe a whole-exome sequencing (WES) precision medicine trial focused on patients with advanced cancer.

Objective
To understand how WES data affect therapeutic decision making in patients with advanced cancer and to identify novel biomarkers of response.

Design, Setting, and Patients
Patients with metastatic and treatment-resistant cancer were prospectively enrolled at a single academic center for paired metastatic tumor and normal tissue WES during a 19-month period (February 2013 through September 2014). A comprehensive computational pipeline was used to detect point mutations, indels, and copy number alterations. Mutations were categorized as category 1, 2, or 3 on the basis of actionability; clinical reports were generated and discussed in precision tumor board. Patients were observed for 7 to 25 months for correlation of molecular information with clinical response.

Main Outcomes and Measures
Feasibility, use of WES for decision making, and identification of novel biomarkers.

Results
A total of 154 tumor-normal pairs from 97 patients with a range of metastatic cancers were sequenced, with a mean coverage of 95× and 16 somatic alterations detected per patient. In total, 16 mutations were category 1 (targeted therapy available), 98 were category 2 (biologically relevant), and 1474 were category 3 (unknown significance). Overall, WES provided informative results in 91 cases (94\%), including alterations for which there is an approved drug, there are therapies in clinical or preclinical development, or they are considered drivers and potentially actionable (category 1-2); however, treatment was guided in only 5 patients (5\%) on the basis of these recommendations because of access to clinical trials and/or off-label use of drugs. Among unexpected findings, a patient with prostate cancer with exceptional response to treatment was identified who harbored a somatic hemizygous deletion of the DNA repair gene FANCA and putative partial loss of function of the second allele through germline missense variant. Follow-up experiments established that loss of FANCA function was associated with platinum hypersensitivity both in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts, thus providing biologic rationale and functional evidence for his extreme clinical response.

Conclusions and Relevance
The majority of advanced, treatment-resistant tumors across tumor types harbor biologically informative alterations. The establishment of a clinical trial for WES of metastatic tumors with prospective follow-up of patients can help identify candidate predictive biomarkers of response.},

Although thousands of cancer-enriched mutated genes have been reported by global sequencing projects, to date, only a few oncogenic mutations have been confirmed as effective biomarkers in cancer therapies. The low frequency and varied profile (i.e., allele frequency, mutation position) of mutant genes among cancer types limit the utility of predictive biomarkers. The recent explosion of cancer transcriptome and phenotypic screening data provides another opportunity for finding transcript-level biomarkers and targets, thus overcoming the limitation of cancer mutation analyses. Technological developments enable the rapid and extensive discovery of potential target-biomarker combinations from large-scale transcriptome-level screening combined with physiologically relevant phenotypic assays. Here, we summarized recent progress as well as discussed the outlook of transcriptome-oriented data mining strategies and phenotypic assays for the identification of non-genetic biomarkers and targets in cancer drug discovery.},

This presents both a critical dilemma in the field of personalized medicine as well as a plethora of opportunities for analysis of RNA-seq data. In this study, we hypothesize that the “Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression” (FAIME) method we developed could be smoothly extended to RNA-seq data and unveil intrinsic underlying mechanism signatures across different scales of biological data for the same complex disease. Using publicly available RNA-seq data for gastric cancer, we confirmed the effectiveness of this method (i) to translate each sample transcriptome to pathway-scale scores, (ii) to predict deregulated pathways in gastric cancer against gold standards (FDR{\textless}5\%, Precision=75\%, Recall =92\%), and (iii) to predict phenotypes in an independent dataset and expression platform (RNA-seq vs microarrays, Fisher Exact Test p{\textless}10−6).

	abstract = {Background
The emergence of precision medicine allowed the incorporation of individual molecular data into patient care. Indeed, DNA sequencing predicts somatic mutations in individual patients. However, these genetic features overlook dynamic epigenetic and phenotypic response to therapy. Meanwhile, accurate personal transcriptome interpretation remains an unmet challenge. Further, N-of-1 (single-subject) efficacy trials are increasingly pursued, but are underpowered for molecular marker discovery.

Method
‘N-of-1-pathways’ is a global framework relying on three principles: (i) the statistical universe is a single patient; (ii) significance is derived from geneset/biomodules powered by paired samples from the same patient; and (iii) similarity between genesets/biomodules assesses commonality and differences, within-study and cross-studies. Thus, patient gene-level profiles are transformed into deregulated pathways. From RNA-Seq of 55 lung adenocarcinoma patients, N-of-1-pathways predicts the deregulated pathways of each patient.

Results
Cross-patient N-of-1-pathways obtains comparable results with conventional genesets enrichment analysis (GSEA) and differentially expressed gene (DEG) enrichment, validated in three external evaluations. Moreover, heatmap and star plots highlight both individual and shared mechanisms ranging from molecular to organ-systems levels (eg, DNA repair, signaling, immune response). Patients were ranked based on the similarity of their deregulated mechanisms to those of an independent gold standard, generating unsupervised clusters of diametric extreme survival phenotypes (p=0.03).

Conclusions
The N-of-1-pathways framework provides a robust statistical and relevant biological interpretation of individual disease-free survival that is often overlooked in conventional cross-patient studies. It enables mechanism-level classifiers with smaller cohorts as well as N-of-1 studies.

We compared human orthologues of these uncharacterized genes in five GWAS consortia and indeed 23 candidate genes are associated with metabolic disease. We further identify common regulatory elements in promoters of candidate genes. As each regulatory element is composed of several transcription factor binding sites, our data reveal an extensive metabolic phenotype-associated network of co-regulated genes. Our systematic mouse phenotype analysis thus paves the way for full functional annotation of the genome.},

	abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is currently the leading technology for genome-wide transcript quantification. While the volume of RNA-seq data is rapidly increasing, the currently publicly available RNA-seq data is provided mostly in raw form, with small portions processed non-uniformly. This is mainly because the computational demand, particularly for the alignment step, is a significant barrier for global and integrative retrospective analyses. To address this challenge, we developed all RNA-seq and ChIP-seq sample and signature search (ARCHS4), a web resource that makes the majority of previously published RNA-seq data from human and mouse freely available at the gene count level. Such uniformly processed data enables easy integration for downstream analyses. For developing the ARCHS4 resource, all available FASTQ files from RNA-seq experiments were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and aligned using a cloud-based infrastructure. In total 137,792 samples are accessible through ARCHS4 with 72,363 mouse and 65,429 human samples. Through efficient use of cloud resources and dockerized deployment of the sequencing pipeline, the alignment cost per sample is reduced to less than one cent. ARCHS4 is updated automatically by adding newly published samples to the database as they become available. Additionally, the ARCHS4 web interface provides intuitive exploration of the processed data through querying tools, interactive visualization, and gene landing pages that provide average expression across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed genes, and predicted biological functions and protein-protein interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined with co-expression. Benchmarking the quality of these predictions, co-expression correlation data created from ARCHS4 outperforms co-expression data created from other major gene expression data repositories such as GTEx and CCLE. ARCHS4 is freely accessible from: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4.},

Here, we review deep learning in bioinformatics, presenting examples of current research. To provide a useful and comprehensive perspective, we categorize research both by the bioinformatics domain (i.e. omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning architecture (i.e. deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, emergent architectures) and present brief descriptions of each study. Additionally, we discuss theoretical and practical issues of deep learning in bioinformatics and suggest future research directions. We believe that this review will provide valuable insights and serve as a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning approaches in their bioinformatics studies.},

To identify the effects of this disorder on mRNA expression, RNA-seq was performed on brain tissue from a knock-in mouse expressing the patient mutation p.Asn1768Asp (N1768D). RNA was isolated from forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem both before and after seizure onset, and from age-matched wildtype littermates. Altered transcript profiles were observed only in forebrain and only after seizures. The abundance of 50 transcripts increased more than 3-fold and 15 transcripts decreased more than 3-fold after seizures. The elevated transcripts included two anti-convulsant neuropeptides and more than a dozen genes involved in reactive astrocytosis and response to neuronal damage. There was no change in the level of transcripts encoding other voltage-gated sodium, potassium or calcium channels. Reactive astrocytosis was observed in the hippocampus of mutant mice after seizures. There is considerable overlap between the genes affected in this genetic model of epilepsy and those altered by chemically induced seizures, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, and inflammation. The data support the view that gain-of-function mutations of SCN8A lead to pathogenic alterations in brain function contributing to encephalopathy.},

After neonatal implantation into myelin-deficient shiverer mice, SCZ GPCs showed premature migration into the cortex, leading to reduced white matter expansion and hypomyelination relative to controls. The SCZ glial chimeras also showed delayed astrocytic differentiation and abnormal astrocytic morphologies. When established in myelin wild-type hosts, SCZ glial mice showed reduced prepulse inhibition and abnormal behavior, including excessive anxiety, antisocial traits, and disturbed sleep. RNA-seq of cultured SCZ human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) revealed disrupted glial differentiation-associated and synaptic gene expression, indicating that glial pathology was cell autonomous.

To identify distinct molecular pathways regulating diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and nephropathy (DN), as well those affected by pioglitazone, we assessed DPN and DN gene transcript expression in control and diabetic mice with or without pioglitazone treatment. Differential expression analysis and self-organizing maps were then used in parallel to analyse transcriptome data. Differential expression analysis showed that gene expression promoting cell death and the inflammatory response was reversed in the kidney glomeruli but unchanged or exacerbated in sciatic nerve by pioglitazone. Self-organizing map analysis revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction was normalized in kidney and nerve by treatment; however, conserved pathways were opposite in their directionality of regulation. Collectively, our data suggest inflammation may drive large fibre dysfunction, while mitochondrial dysfunction may drive small fibre dysfunction in T2DM. Moreover, targeting both of these pathways is likely to improve DN. This study supports growing evidence that systemic metabolic changes in T2DM are associated with distinct tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming in kidney and nerve and that these changes play a critical role in DN and small fibre DPN pathogenesis. These data also highlight the potential dangers of a 'one size fits all' approach to T2DM therapeutics, as the same drug may simultaneously alleviate one complication while exacerbating another.},

Recent reports linked expression of the DYT1-causing protein with dysregulation of eIF2α, a key component of the cellular response to ER stress known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the response of the DYT1 mammalian brain to acute ER stress inducers has not been evaluated in vivo. We hypothesized that torsinA regulates the neuronal UPR and expression of its mutant form would alter this process. TorsinA was post-transcriptionally upregulated upon acute ER stress in different models, suggesting a role in this response. Moreover, increased basal phosphorylation of eIF2α in DYT1 transgenic rats was associated with an abnormal response to acute ER stress. Finally, an unbiased RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analysis of embryonic brain tissue in heterozygous and homozygous DYT1 knockin mice confirmed the presence of eIF2α dysregulation in the DYT1 brain. In sum, these findings support previous reports linking torsinA function, eIF2α signaling and the neuronal response to ER stress in vivo.

Currently, there is no treatment to slow progression of these diseases. Here, we have investigated whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an inducer of the transcription factor NRF2, could mitigate tauopathy in a mouse model. The signaling pathways modulated by DMF were also studied in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) from wild type or KEAP1-deficient mice. The effect of DMF on neurodegeneration, astrocyte and microglial activation was examined in Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice stereotaxically injected in the right hippocampus with an adeno-associated vector expressing human TAUP301L and treated daily with DMF (100mg/kg, i.g) during three weeks. DMF induces the NRF2 transcriptional through a mechanism that involves KEAP1 but also PI3K/AKT/GSK-3-dependent pathways. DMF modulates GSK-3β activity in mouse hippocampi. Furthermore, DMF modulates TAU phosphorylation, neuronal impairment measured by calbindin-D28K and BDNF expression, and inflammatory processes involved in astrogliosis, microgliosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. This study reveals neuroprotective effects of DMF beyond disruption of the KEAP1/NRF2 axis by inhibiting GSK3 in a mouse model of tauopathy.

	abstract = {Characterizing the transcriptome architecture of the human brain is fundamental in gaining an understanding of brain function and disease. A number of recent studies have investigated patterns of brain gene expression obtained from an extensive anatomical coverage across the entire human brain using experimental data generated by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) project. In this paper, we propose a new representation of a gene's transcription activity that explicitly captures the pattern of spatial co-expression across different anatomical brain regions. For each gene, we define a Spatial Expression Network (SEN), a network quantifying co-expression patterns amongst several anatomical locations. Network similarity measures are then employed to quantify the topological resemblance between pairs of SENs and identify naturally occurring clusters. Using network-theoretical measures, three large clusters have been detected featuring distinct topological properties. We then evaluate whether topological diversity of the SENs reflects significant differences in biological function through a gene ontology analysis. We report on evidence suggesting that one of the three SEN clusters consists of genes specifically involved in the nervous system, including genes related to brain disorders, while the remaining two clusters are representative of immunity, transcription and translation. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that brain gene clusters are generally associated with one of these three major biological processes.},

We quantify the information preserved from the original datasets under a graph-theoretical framework and evaluate how cross-stress features can be identified. This is performed both from a node and a network community organization point of view. Cluster analysis, here viewed as a problem of network partitioning, is achieved under state-of-the-art algorithms relying on the properties of stochastic processes on the constructed graphs. Relative performance with respect to a metric-free Bayesian clustering analysis is evaluated and possible extensions are discussed. We further cluster the stress-induced co-expression networks generated independently by using their community organization at multiple scales.

	abstract = {The increasing capacity of high-throughput genomic technologies for generating time-course data has stimulated a rich debate on the most appropriate methods to highlight crucial aspects of data structure. In this work, we address the problem of sparse co-expression network representation of several time-course stress responses in \{{\textbackslash}it Saccharomyces cerevisiae\}. We quantify the information preserved from the original datasets under a graph-theoretical framework and evaluate how cross-stress features can be identified. This is performed both from a node and a network community organization point of view. Cluster analysis, here viewed as a problem of network partitioning, is achieved under state-of-the-art algorithms relying on the properties of stochastic processes on the constructed graphs. Relative performance with respect to a metric-free Bayesian clustering analysis is evaluated and possible extensions are discussed. We further cluster the stress-induced co-expression networks generated independently by using their community organization at multiple scales.

	shorttitle = {{wTO}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04702},
	abstract = {Background: Gene co-expression network analyses have become a central approach for the systems-level analysis of biological data. Several software packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However, since some genes are able to up- or down-regulate other genes, it is important to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network. Additionally, there has been a growing interest in the systematic comparison of multiple networks to identify deferentially changed links. Typically, such analyses are focused on the comparison of networks or data from two different conditions. Results: Here, we present an R package for calculating the weighted topological overlap (wTO), that explicitly addresses the sign of wTO values. The package includes the calculation of p-values (raw and adjusted) for each pairwise gene score. Our package also allows the calculation of networks from time series, without replicates. Additionally, our R package incorporates a novel method for calculating a consensus network (CN) from two or more networks. To visualize the resulting networks, the R package contains a visualization tool which allows for the direct network manipulation and access of node and link information. When testing the package on a standard laptop computer, we can conduct all calculations for systems of 20,000 genes in under two hours. Conclusion: In this work, we developed an R package that allows the computation of wTO networks, CNs and a visualization tool in the R statistical environment. It is publicly available on CRAN repositories under the GPL-2 Open Source License (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wTO/).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03400},
	abstract = {A central claim in modern network science is that real-world networks are typically "scale free," meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree \$k\$ follows a power law, decaying like \$k{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, often with \$2 {\textless} {\textbackslash}alpha {\textless} 3\$. However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain.},

We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways.

An alternative strategy is to characterize those genes that are selectively enriched in the SCN. Here, we examined the transcriptome of the SCN and whole brain (WB) of mice using meta-analysis of publicly deposited data across a range of microarray platforms and RNA-Seq data. A total of 79 microarrays were used (24 SCN and 55 WB samples, 4 different microarray platforms), alongside 17 RNA-Seq data files (7 SCN and 10 WB). 31 684 MGI gene symbols had data for at least one platform. Meta-analysis using a random effects model for weighting individual effect sizes (derived from differential expression between relevant SCN and WB samples) reliably detected known SCN markers. SCN-enriched transcripts identified in this study provide novel insights into SCN function, including identifying genes which may play key roles in SCN physiology or provide SCN-specific drivers.},

	abstract = {Despite considerable genetic heterogeneity underlying neurodevelopmental diseases, there is compelling evidence that many disease genes will map to a much smaller number of biological subnetworks. We developed a computational method, termed MAGI (merging affected genes into integrated networks), that simultaneously integrates protein-protein interactions and RNA-seq expression profiles during brain development to discover "modules" enriched for de novo mutations in probands. We applied this method to recent exome sequencing of 1116 patients with autism and intellectual disability, discovering two distinct modules that differ in their properties and associated phenotypes. The first module consists of 80 genes associated with Wnt, Notch, SWI/SNF, and NCOR complexes and shows the highest expression early during embryonic development (8-16 post-conception weeks [pcw]). The second module consists of 24 genes associated with synaptic function, including long-term potentiation and calcium signaling with higher levels of postnatal expression. Patients with de novo mutations in these modules are more significantly intellectually impaired and carry more severe missense mutations when compared to probands with de novo mutations outside of these modules. We used our approach to define subsets of the network associated with higher functioning autism as well as greater severity with respect to IQ. Finally, we applied MAGI independently to epilepsy and schizophrenia exome sequencing cohorts and found significant overlap as well as expansion of these modules, suggesting a core set of integrated neurodevelopmental networks common to seemingly diverse human diseases.},

	abstract = {Mapping of the human genome has been instrumental in understanding diseases caused by changes in single genes. However, disease mechanisms involving multiple genes have proven to be much more elusive. Their complexity emerges from interactions of intracellular molecules and makes them immune to the traditional reductionist approach. Only by modelling this complex interaction pattern using networks is it possible to understand the emergent properties that give rise to diseases. The overarching term used to describe both physical and indirect interactions involved in the same functions is functional association. FunCoup is one of the most comprehensive networks of functional association. It uses a naïve Bayesian approach to integrate high-throughput experimental evidence of intracellular interactions in humans and multiple model organisms. In the first update, both the coverage and the quality of the interactions, were increased and a feature for comparing interactions across species was added. The latest update involved a complete overhaul of all data sources, including a refinement of the training data and addition of new class and sources of interactions as well as six new species. Disease-specific changes in genes can be identified using high-throughput genome-wide studies of patients and healthy individuals. To understand the underlying mechanisms that produce these changes, they can be mapped to collections of genes with known functions, such as pathways. BinoX was developed to map altered genes to pathways using the topology of FunCoup. This approach combined with a new randommodel for comparison enables BinoX to outperform traditional gene-overlap-based methods and other networkbased techniques. Results from high-throughput experiments are challenged by noise and biases, resulting in many false positives. Statistical attempts to correct for these challenges have led to a reduction in coverage. Both limitations can be remedied using prioritisation tools such as MaxLink, which ranks genes using guilt by association in the context of a functional association network. MaxLink’s algorithm was generalised to work with any disease phenotype and its statistical foundation was strengthened. MaxLink’s predictions were validated experimentally using FRET. The availability of prioritisation tools without an appropriate way to compare them makes it difficult to select the correct tool for a problem domain. A benchmark to assess performance of prioritisation tools in terms of their ability to generalise to new data was developed. FunCoup was used for prioritisation while testing was done using cross-validation of terms derived from Gene Ontology. This resulted in a robust and unbiased benchmark for evaluation of current and future prioritisation tools. Surprisingly, previously superior tools based on global network structure were shown to be inferior to a local network-based tool when performance was analysed on the most relevant part of the output, i.e. the top ranked genes. This thesis demonstrates how a network that models the intricate biology of the cell can contribute with valuable insights for researchers that study diseases with complex genetic origins.

	abstract = {Background
The mouse inbred line C57BL/6J is widely used in mouse genetics and its genome has been incorporated into many genetic reference populations. More recently large initiatives such as the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) are using the C57BL/6N mouse strain to generate null alleles for all mouse genes. Hence both strains are now widely used in mouse genetics studies. Here we perform a comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of the two strains to identify differences that may influence their underlying genetic mechanisms.

Results
We undertake genome sequence comparisons of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N to identify SNPs, indels and structural variants, with a focus on identifying all coding variants. We annotate 34 SNPs and 2 indels that distinguish C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N coding sequences, as well as 15 structural variants that overlap a gene. In parallel we assess the comparative phenotypes of the two inbred lines utilizing the EMPReSSslim phenotyping pipeline, a broad based assessment encompassing diverse biological systems. We perform additional secondary phenotyping assessments to explore other phenotype domains and to elaborate phenotype differences identified in the primary assessment. We uncover significant phenotypic differences between the two lines, replicated across multiple centers, in a number of physiological, biochemical and behavioral systems.

Conclusions
Comparison of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N demonstrates a range of phenotypic differences that have the potential to impact upon penetrance and expressivity of mutational effects in these strains. Moreover, the sequence variants we identify provide a set of candidate genes for the phenotypic differences observed between the two strains.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing data are widely collected and analyzed in the study of complex diseases in quest of improving human health. Well-studied algorithms mostly deal with single data source, and cannot fully utilize the potential of these multi-omics data sources. In order to provide a holistic understanding of human health and diseases, it is necessary to integrate multiple data sources. Several algorithms have been proposed so far, however, a comprehensive comparison of data integration algorithms for classification of binary traits is currently lacking.
RESULTS: In this paper, we focus on two common classes of integration algorithms, graph-based that depict relationships with subjects denoted by nodes and relationships denoted by edges, and kernel-based that can generate a classifier in feature space. Our paper provides a comprehensive comparison of their performance in terms of various measurements of classification accuracy and computation time. Seven different integration algorithms, including graph-based semi-supervised learning, graph sharpening integration, composite association network, Bayesian network, semi-definite programming-support vector machine (SDP-SVM), relevance vector machine (RVM) and Ada-boost relevance vector machine are compared and evaluated with hypertension and two cancer data sets in our study. In general, kernel-based algorithms create more complex models and require longer computation time, but they tend to perform better than graph-based algorithms. The performance of graph-based algorithms has the advantage of being faster computationally.
CONCLUSIONS: The empirical results demonstrate that composite association network, relevance vector machine, and Ada-boost RVM are the better performers. We provide recommendations on how to choose an appropriate algorithm for integrating data from multiple sources.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Understanding functions of proteins in specific human tissues is essential for insights into disease diagnostics and therapeutics, yet prediction of tissue-specific cellular function remains a critical challenge for biomedicine.Results: Here, we present OhmNet, a hierarchy-aware unsupervised node feature learning approach for multi-layer networks. We build a multi-layer network, where each layer represents molecular interactions in a different human tissue. OhmNet then automatically learns a mapping of proteins, represented as nodes, to a neural embedding-based low-dimensional space of features. OhmNet encourages sharing of similar features among proteins with similar network neighborhoods and among proteins activated in similar tissues. The algorithm generalizes prior work, which generally ignores relationships between tissues, by modeling tissue organization with a rich multiscale tissue hierarchy. We use OhmNet to study multicellular function in a multi-layer protein interaction network of 107 human tissues. In 48 tissues with known tissue-specific cellular functions, OhmNet provides more accurate predictions of cellular function than alternative approaches, and also generates more accurate hypotheses about tissue-specific protein actions. We show that taking into account the tissue hierarchy leads to improved predictive power. Remarkably, we also demonstrate that it is possible to leverage the tissue hierarchy in order to effectively transfer cellular functions to a functionally uncharacterized tissue. Overall, OhmNet moves from flat networks to multiscale models able to predict a range of phenotypes spanning cellular subsystems.

However, functional labels with only a few (\&lt;10) annotated genes, which constitute about half of the GO terms in yeast, mouse and human, pose a unique challenge in that any prediction algorithm that independently considers each label faces a paucity of information and thus is prone to capture non-generalizable patterns in the data, resulting in poor predictive performance. There exist a variety of algorithms for function prediction, but none properly address this ‘overfitting’ issue of sparsely annotated functions, or do so in a manner scalable to tens of thousands of functions in the human catalog.Results: We propose a novel function prediction algorithm, clusDCA, which transfers information between similar functional labels to alleviate the overfitting problem for sparsely annotated functions. Our method is scalable to datasets with a large number of annotations. In a cross-validation experiment in yeast, mouse and human, our method greatly outperformed previous state-of-the-art function prediction algorithms in predicting sparsely annotated functions, without sacrificing the performance on labels with sufficient information. Furthermore, we show that our method can accurately predict genes that will be assigned a functional label that has no known annotations, based only on the ontology graph structure and genes associated with other labels, which further suggests that our method effectively utilizes the similarity between gene functions.Availability and implementation:https://github.com/wangshenguiuc/clusDCA.Contact:jianpeng@illinois.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The primary challenge involves identifying the relevant cell types and the causal variants among the vast majority of the associated mutations in the noncoding regions. To address this challenge, we developed an efficient probabilistic framework. First, we propose a sparse group-guided learning algorithm to infer cell-type-specific enrichments. Second, we propose a fine-mapping Bayesian model that incorporates as Bayesian priors the sparse enrichments to infer risk variants. Using the proposed framework to analyze 32 complex human traits revealed meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments indicative of the relevant disease pathologies. The prioritized variants exhibit prominent tissue-specific epigenomic signatures and significant enrichments for eQTL and conserved elements. Together, we demonstrate the general benefits of the proposed integrative framework in elucidating meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic elements from large-scale correlated annotations and the implicated functional variants for future experimental interrogation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07918},
	abstract = {Important cellular processes such as migration, differentiation, and development often rely on precise timing. Yet, the molecular machinery that regulates timing is inherently noisy. How do cells achieve precise timing with noisy components? We investigate this question using a first-passage-time approach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance threshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a diminishing repressor. We find that the optimal strategy corresponds to a nonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time. Optimality arises from a tradeoff between minimizing the extrinsic timing noise of the regulator, and minimizing the intrinsic timing noise of the target molecule itself. Although either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated strategy, when we consider the effects of cell division, we find that repression outperforms activation if division occurs late in the process. Our results explain the nonlinear increase and low noise of mig-1 gene expression in migrating neuroblast cells during Caenorhabditis elegans development, and suggest that mig-1 regulation is dominated by repression for maximal temporal precision. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation may be a simple and powerful strategy for precise cellular timing.},

	doi = {10.1124/jpet.102.044040},
	abstract = {The functions of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the central nervous system (CNS) can be conceptualized as performed by four anatomically distinct components that together comprise a general TRH homeostatic system. These components are 1) the hypothalamic-hypophysiotropic neuroendocrine system, 2) the brainstem/midbrain/spinal cord system, 3) the limbic/cortical system, and 4) the chronobiological system. We propose that the main neurobiological function of TRH is to promote homeostasis, accomplished through neuronal mechanisms resident in these four integrated systems. This hypothesis offers a unifying basis for understanding the myriad actions of TRH and TRH-related drugs already demonstrated in animals and humans. It is consistent with the traditional role of TRH as a regulator of metabolic homeostasis. An appreciation of the global function of TRH to modulate and normalize CNS activity, along with an appreciation of the inherent limitations of TRH itself as a therapeutic agent, leads to rational expectations of therapeutic benefit from metabolically stable TRH-mimetic drugs in a remarkably broad spectrum of clinical situations, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to other therapeutic agents. The actions of TRH are numerous and varied. This has been viewed in the past as a conceptual and practical impediment to the development of TRH analogs. Herein, we alternatively propose that these manifold actions should be considered as a rational and positive impetus to the development of TRH-based drugs with the potential for unique and widespread applicability in human illness.},

	abstract = {The UK Chief Medical Officer’s 2016 Annual Report, Generation Genome, focused on a vision to fully integrate genomics into all aspects of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). This process of integration, which has now already begun, raises a wide range of social and ethical concerns, many of which were discussed in the final Chapter of the report. This paper explores how the UK’s 100,000 Genomes Project (100 kGP)—the catalyst for Generation Genome, and for bringing genomics into the NHS—is negotiating these ethical concerns. The UK’s 100 kGP, promoted and delivered by Genomics England Limited (GEL), is an innovative venture aiming to sequence 100,000 genomes from NHS patients who have a rare disease, cancer, or an infectious disease. GEL has emphasised the importance of ethical governance and decision-making. However, some sociological critique argues that biomedical/technological organisations presenting themselves as ‘ethical’ entities do not necessarily reflect a space within which moral thinking occurs. Rather, the ‘ethical work’ conducted (and displayed) by organisations is more strategic, relating to the politics of the organisation and the need to build public confidence. We set out to explore whether GEL’s ethical framework was reflective of this critique, and what this tells us more broadly about how genomics is being integrated into the NHS in response to the ethical and social concerns raised in Generation Genome. We do this by drawing on a series of 20 interviews with individuals associated with or working at GEL.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often show obsessive repetitive symptoms that are characteristic to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Aberrant glutamate function has been suggested to a risk for both ASDs and OCD. Considering the common metabolic pathway and recent results from association studies both in OCD and ASDs, a question, whether there is common molecular background in ASDs and OCD, was raised.
METHODS: Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 9p24 and 11p12-p13 containing glutamate transporter genes SLC1A1 and SLC1A2 and their neighboring regions in 175 patients with ASDs and 216 controls of Finnish origin were analyzed using real-time-PCR or direct sequencing.
RESULTS: The strongest association was detected with rs1340513 in the JMJD2C gene at 9p24.1 (P=0.007; corrected P=0.011) that is the same SNP associated with infantile autism (P=0.0007) in the autism genome project consortium (2007). No association was detected at 11p12-p13 with ASD. Interestingly, the strongest association in OCD has been found at rs301443 (P=0.000067) residing between SLC1A1 and JMJD2C at 9p24.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our results give evidence for a possible common locus for OCD and ASDs at 9p24. We speculate that the area may represent a special candidate region for obsessive repetitive symptoms in ASDs.},

Our experience has shown that this has been most evidenced in long-term assessment of wheel-running activity in mice. Historically, wheel-running in mice and other rodents have been used as a robust assay to determine, with precision, the inherent period of circadian rhythms in mice. Furthermore, this assay has been instrumental in dissecting the molecular genetic basis of mammalian circadian rhythms. In teasing out the elements of this test that have determined its robustness - automated assessment of an unforced behaviour in the home cage over long time intervals - we and others have been investigating whether similar test apparatus could be used to accurately discriminate differences in distinct behavioural parameters in mice. Firstly, using these systems, we explored behaviours in a number of mouse inbred strains to determine whether we could extract biologically meaningful differences. Secondly, we tested a number of relevant mutant lines to determine how discriminative these parameters were. Our findings show that, when compared to conventional out-of-cage phenotyping, a far deeper understanding of mouse mutant phenotype can be established by monitoring behaviour in the home cage over one or more light:dark cycles.},

The current system for characterizing these mice usually involves removing the animals from their home-cage environment and placing them into novel environments where they undergo a battery of tests measuring a range of behavioral and physical phenotypes. These tests are often only conducted for short periods of times in social isolation. However, human manifestations of such disorders are often characterized by multiple phenotypes, presented over long periods of time and leading to significant social impacts. Here, we have developed a system which will allow the automated monitoring of individual mice housed socially in the cage they are reared and housed in, within established social groups and over long periods of time. We demonstrate that the system accurately reports individual locomotor behavior within the group and that the measurements taken can provide unique insights into the effects of genetic background on individual and group behavior not previously recognized.},

These diverse, complex and often high-dimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolkit.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05813},
	abstract = {Bioinformatics research depends on high-quality databases to provide accurate results. In silico experiments, correctly performed, may prospect novel discoveries and elucidates pathways for biological experiments through data analysis in large scale. However, most biological databases have presented mistakes, such as data incorrectly classified or incomplete information. Also, sometimes, data mining algorithms cannot treat these errors, leading to serious problems for the in silico analysis. Manual curation of data extracted from literature is a possible solution for this problem. Systematic Literature Review (SLR), or Systematic Review, is a method to identify, evaluate and summarize the state-of-the-art of a specific theme. Moreover, SLR allows the collection from databases restrictively, which allows an analysis with lower bias than traditional reviews. The SRL approaches have been widely used for decision-making in medical and environmental studies. However, other research areas, such as bioinformatics, do not have a specific step-by-step to guide researchers undertaking the procedures of an SLR. In this study, we propose a guideline, called BiSRL, to perform SLR in bioinformatics. Our procedures cover the most traditional guides to produce SLRs adapted to bioinformatics. To evaluate our method, we propose a case study to detect and summarize SLRs developed for bioinformatics data. We used two databases: PubMed and ScienceDirect. A total of 207 papers were screened in four steps: title, abstract, diagonal and full-text reading. Four evaluators performed the SLR independently to reduce bias risk. A total of 8 papers was included in the SLR case study. The case study demonstrates how to implement the methods of BiSLR to procedure SLR for bioinformatics. BiSLR may guide bioinformaticians to perform systematic reviews reproducible to collect accurate data for higher quality analysis.},

Several databases have been constructed for gene coexpression in model organisms based on a large amount of publicly available gene expression data measured by GeneChip platforms. In these databases, Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) of gene expression patterns are widely used as a measure of gene coexpression. Although the coexpression measure or GeneChip summarization method affects the performance of the gene coexpression database, previous studies for these calculation procedures were tested with only a small number of samples and a particular species. To evaluate the effectiveness of coexpression measures, assessments with large-scale microarray data are required. We first examined characteristics of PCC and found that the optimal PCC threshold to retrieve functionally related genes was affected by the method of gene expression database construction and the target gene function. In addition, we found that this problem could be overcome when we used correlation ranks instead of correlation values. This observation was evaluated by large-scale gene expression data for four species: Arabidopsis, human, mouse and rat.},

Functional analysis of coexpressed genes has succeeded in the biomedical field in identifying key drivers of disease pathways. However, in ecology and evolutionary biology, functional interpretation of transcriptomic data is still limited. Here, we used Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of coexpressed genes in muscle and brain tissue of a lake whitefish backcross progeny. Modules were connected to gradients of known adaptive traits involved in the ecological speciation process between benthic and limnetic ecotypes. Key drivers, that is, hub genes of functional modules related to reproduction, growth, and behavior were identified, and module preservation was assessed in natural populations. Using this approach, we identified modules of coexpressed genes involved in phenotypic divergence and their key drivers, and further identified a module part specifically rewired in the backcross progeny. Functional analysis of transcriptomic data can significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying ecological speciation. Our findings point to bone morphogenetic protein and calcium signaling as common pathways involved in coordinated evolution of trophic behavior, trophic morphology (gill rakers), and reproduction. Results also point to pathways implicating hemoglobins and constitutive stress response (HSP70) governing growth in lake whitefish.},

An appropriate visualization of data is crucial for understanding such networks, since pathways are related to functions that occur in specific regions of the cell. The force-directed layout is an important and widely used technique to draw networks according to their topologies. Placing the networks into cellular compartments helps to quickly identify where network elements are located and, more specifically, concentrated. Currently, only a few tools provide the capability of visually organizing networks by cellular compartments. Most of them cannot handle large and dense networks.

	abstract = {Not later than two synapses after their arrival in the cerebellar cortex all excitatory afferent signals are subsequently transformed into inhibitory ones. Guaranteed by the exceedingly ordered and stereotyped synaptic arrangement of its cellular elements, the cerebellar cortex transmits this inhibitory result of cerebellar integration exclusively via Purkinje cells (PCs) in a precise temporal succession directly onto the target neurons of the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. Thus the cerebellar cortex seems to produce a temporal pattern of inhibitory influence on these target neurons that modifies their excitatory action in such a way that an activation of muscle fibers occurs which progressively integrates the intended motion into the actual condition of the motoric inventory. In consequence, disturbances that affect this cerebellar inhibition will cause uncoordinated, decomposed and ataxic movements, commonly referred to as cerebellar ataxia. Electrophysiological investigations using different cerebellar mouse mutants have shown that alterations in the cerebellar inhibitory input in the target nuclei lead to diverse neuronal responses and to different consequences for the behavioural phenotype. A dependence between the reconstitution of inhibition and the behavioural outcome seems to exist. Obviously two different basic mechanisms are responsible for these observations: (1) ineffective inhibition on target neurons by surviving PCs; and (2) enhancement of intranuclear inhibition in the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. Which of the two strategies evolves is dependent upon the composition of the residual cell types in the cerebellum and on the degree of PC input loss in a given area of the target nuclei. Motor behaviour seems to deteriorate under the first of these mechanisms whereas it may benefit from the second. This is substantiated by stereotaxic removal of the remaining PC input, which eliminates the influence of the first mechanism and is able to induce the second strategy. As a consequence, motor performance improves considerably. In this review, results leading to the above conclusions are presented and links forged to human cerebellar diseases.},

	abstract = {Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant ataxia caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the exon 1 of the gene ATXN2, conferring a gain of toxic function that triggers the appearance of the disease phenotype. SCA2 is characterized by several symptoms including progressive gait ataxia and dysarthria, slow saccadic eye movements, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and psychological dysfunctions such as insomnia and depression, among others. The available treatments rely on palliative care, which mitigate some of the major symptoms but ultimately fail to block the disease progression. This persistent lack of effective therapies led to the development of several models in yeast, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and mice to serve as platforms for testing new therapeutic strategies and to accelerate the research on the complex disease mechanisms. In this work, we review 4 transgenic and 1 knock-in mouse that exhibit a SCA2-related phenotype and discuss their usefulness in addressing different scientific problems. The knock-in mice are extremely faithful to the human disease, with late onset of symptoms and physiological levels of mutant ataxin-2, while the other transgenic possess robust and well-characterized motor impairments and neuropathological features. Furthermore, a new BAC model of SCA2 shows promise to study the recently explored role of non-coding RNAs as a major pathogenic mechanism in this devastating disorder. Focusing on specific aspects of the behavior and neuropathology, as well as technical aspects, we provide a highly practical description and comparison of all the models with the purpose of creating a useful resource for SCA2 researchers worldwide.},

	abstract = {Objective
To describe in this review how research using mouse models developed to study the Fragile X premutation (PM) and Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) have contributed to understanding these disorders. PM carriers bear an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat on the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, and are at risk for developing the late-onset neurodegenerative disorder FXTAS.

Conclusions
Much has been learned about these genetic disorders from the development and study of mouse models. This includes new insights into the early cellular and molecular events that occur in PM carriers and in FXTAS, the presence of multi-organ pathology beyond the CNS, immunological dysregulation, unexpected synthesis of a potentially toxic peptide in FXTAS (i.e., FMRpolyG), and evidence that the disease process may be halted or reversed by appropriate molecular therapies given early in the course of disease.},

To review progress in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and novel approaches to treatment.

Results and conclusions:
Autosomal dominant ataxias are now referred to as SCAs, with polyglutamine expansion mutations constituting the most common cause of SCAs. Phenotypic variation in patients with SCA is remarkable even in patients with identical mutations. In patients with SCA2, cerebellar ataxia is typically associated with slowed saccadic eye movements. In addition to classic cerebellar and brainstem signs, however, SCA2 can also present as a parkinsonian syndrome or as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. After identifying the SCA2 gene (gene symbol ATXN2) in 1996, we generated several mouse models that recapitulated salient features of the human disease. In these models, behavioral and physiologic changes preceded cell death. Modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) provide a unique tool to target mRNA transcripts in vivo with extended stability of ASOs and better activation of RNAse H. We generated methoxyethyl group–gapmer ASOs that reduced ATXN2 expression {\textgreater}80\% in vitro and then progressed the lead ASO to in vivo testing in an SCA2 mouse model. Compared to intraventricular injection of saline, treatment with ASO resulted in significant knockdown of endogenous mouse and human transgenic ATXN2. In addition, progression of the motor phenotype was slowed and Purkinje cell firing in the acute cerebellar slice normalized. ASO-based therapies are underway in humans providing hope that this approach will also be applicable to patients with cerebellar degenerations.},

	abstract = {Degenerative ataxias are a common form of neurodegenerative disease that affect about 20 individuals per 100,000. The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by a variety of protein coding mutations (single nucleotide changes, deletions and expansions) in single genes. Affected genes encode plasma membrane and intracellular ion channels, membrane receptors, protein kinases, protein phosphatases and proteins of unknown function. Although SCA‐linked genes are quite diverse they share two key features: first, they are highly, although not exclusively, expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PNs), and second, when mutated they lead ultimately to the degeneration of PNs. In this review we summarize ataxia‐related changes in PN neurophysiology that have been observed in various mouse knockout lines and in transgenic models of human SCA. We also highlight emerging evidence that altered metabotropic glutamate receptor signalling and disrupted calcium homeostasis in PNs form a common, early pathophysiological mechanism in SCAs. Together these findings indicate that aberrant calcium signalling and profound changes in PN neurophysiology precede PN cell loss and are likely to lead to cerebellar circuit dysfunction that explains behavioural signs of ataxia characteristic of the disease.},

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a typical genomic instability syndrome whose major characteristic is progressive neuronal degeneration but is also associated with immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition and acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals. A-T is caused by loss or inactivation of the ATM protein kinase, which mobilizes the complex, multi-branched cellular response to double strand breaks in the DNA by phosphorylating numerous DDR players. The link between ATM's function in the DDR and the neuronal demise in A-T has been questioned in the past. However, recent studies of the ATM-mediated DDR in neurons suggest that the neurological phenotype in A-T is indeed caused by deficiency in this function, similar to other features of the disease. Still, major issues concerning this phenotype remain open, including the presumed differences between the DDR in post-mitotic neurons and proliferating cells, the nature of the damage that accumulates in the DNA of ATM-deficient neurons under normal life conditions, the mode of death of ATM-deficient neurons, and the lack of a major neuronal phenotype in the mouse model of A-T.

	abstract = {Background
The classification of autosomal recessive ataxias represents a significant challenge because of high genetic heterogeneity and complex phenotypes. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of the literature to examine all recessive ataxias in order to propose a new classification and properly circumscribe this field as new technologies are emerging for comprehensive targeted gene testing.

Methods
We searched Pubmed and Embase to identify original articles on recessive forms of ataxia in humans for which a causative gene had been identified. Reference lists and public databases, including OMIM and GeneReviews, were also reviewed. We evaluated the clinical descriptions to determine if ataxia was a core feature of the phenotype and assessed the available evidence on the genotype-phenotype association. Included disorders were classified as primary recessive ataxias, as other complex movement or multisystem disorders with prominent ataxia, or as disorders that may occasionally present with ataxia.

Results
After removal of duplicates, 2354 references were reviewed and assessed for inclusion. A total of 130 articles were completely reviewed and included in this qualitative analysis. The proposed new list of autosomal recessive ataxias includes 45 gene-defined disorders for which ataxia is a core presenting feature. We propose a clinical algorithm based on the associated symptoms.

Conclusion
We present a new classification for autosomal recessive ataxias that brings awareness to their complex phenotypes while providing a unified categorization of this group of disorders. This review should assist in the development of a consensus nomenclature useful in both clinical and research applications.

	abstract = {In many applications, one is interested in determining which of the properties of a network module change across conditions. For example, to validate the existence of a module, it is desirable to show that it is reproducible (or preserved) in an independent test network. Here we study several types of network preservation statistics that do not require a module assignment in the test network. We distinguish network preservation statistics by the type of the underlying network. Some preservation statistics are defined for a general network (defined by an adjacency matrix) while others are only defined for a correlation network (constructed on the basis of pairwise correlations between numeric variables). Our applications show that the correlation structure facilitates the definition of particularly powerful module preservation statistics. We illustrate that evaluating module preservation is in general different from evaluating cluster preservation. We find that it is advantageous to aggregate multiple preservation statistics into summary preservation statistics. We illustrate the use of these methods in six gene co-expression network applications including 1) preservation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in mouse tissues, 2) comparison of human and chimpanzee brain networks, 3) preservation of selected KEGG pathways between human and chimpanzee brain networks, 4) sex differences in human cortical networks, 5) sex differences in mouse liver networks. While we find no evidence for sex specific modules in human cortical networks, we find that several human cortical modules are less preserved in chimpanzees. In particular, apoptosis genes are differentially co-expressed between humans and chimpanzees. Our simulation studies and applications show that module preservation statistics are useful for studying differences between the modular structure of networks. Data, R software and accompanying tutorials can be downloaded from the following webpage: http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/ModulePreservation., In network applications, one is often interested in studying whether modules are preserved across multiple networks. For example, to determine whether a pathway of genes is perturbed in a certain condition, one can study whether its connectivity pattern is no longer preserved. Non-preserved modules can either be biologically uninteresting (e.g., reflecting data outliers) or interesting (e.g., reflecting sex specific modules). An intuitive approach for studying module preservation is to cross-tabulate module membership. But this approach often cannot address questions about the preservation of connectivity patterns between nodes. Thus, cross-tabulation based approaches often fail to recognize that important aspects of a network module are preserved. Cross-tabulation methods make it difficult to argue that a module is not preserved. The weak statement (“the reference module does not overlap with any of the identified test set modules”) is less relevant in practice than the strong statement (“the module cannot be found in the test network irrespective of the parameter settings of the module detection procedure”). Module preservation statistics have important applications, e.g. we show that the wiring of apoptosis genes in a human cortical network differs from that in chimpanzees.},

Notably, SNAP-25 has been implicated in schizophrenia from genetic [], pathological [], and functional studies []. We show here that the rest and activity rhythms of Bdr mice are phase advanced and fragmented under a light/dark cycle, reminiscent of the disturbed sleep patterns observed in schizophrenia. Retinal inputs appear normal in mutants, and clock gene rhythms within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are normally phased both in vitro and in vivo. However, the 24 hr rhythms of arginine vasopressin within the SCN and plasma corticosterone are both markedly phase advanced in Bdr mice. We suggest that the Bdr circadian phenotype arises from a disruption of synaptic connectivity within the SCN that alters critical output signals.

This may be especially important in practical terms when real-world applications of the classifier are either highly imbalanced or occur in unknown proportions. Intuitively, it may seem sensible to train machine learning models on data similar to the target data in terms of proportions of the two binary outcomes. However, we show that this is not the case using the example of prediction of deleterious and neutral phenotypes of human missense mutations in human genome data, for which the proportion of the binary outcome is unknown. Our results indicate that using balanced training data (50\% neutral and 50\% deleterious) results in the highest balanced accuracy (the average of True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate), Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under ROC curves, no matter what the proportions of the two phenotypes are in the testing data. Besides balancing the data by undersampling the majority class, other techniques in machine learning include oversampling the minority class, interpolating minority-class data points and various penalties for misclassifying the minority class. However, these techniques are not commonly used in either the missense phenotype prediction problem or in the prediction of disordered residues in proteins, where the imbalance problem is substantial. The appropriate approach depends on the amount of available data and the specific problem at hand.},

	abstract = {Homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells offers an exquisitely precise mechanism to introduce targeted modifications to the mouse genome. This ability to produce specific alterations to the mouse genome has become an essential tool for the analysis of gene function and the development of mouse models of human disease. Of the many thousands of mouse alleles that have been generated by gene targeting, the majority are designed to completely ablate gene function, to create conditional alleles that are inactivated in the presence of Cre recombinase, or to produce reporter alleles that label-specific tissues or cell populations (Eppig et al., 2012, Nucleic Acids Res 40:D881-D886). However, there is a variety of powerful motivations for the introduction of subtle targeted mutations (STMs) such as point mutations, small deletions, or small insertions into the mouse genome. The introduction of STMs allows the ablation of specific transcript isoforms, permits the functional investigation of particular domains or amino acids within a protein, provides the ability to study the role of specific sites with in cis-regulatory elements, and can result in better mouse models of human genetic disorders. In this review, I examine the current strategies that are commonly used to introduce STMs into the mouse genome and highlight new gene targeting technologies, including TALENs and CRISPR/Cas, which are likely to influence the future of gene targeting in mice.},

	abstract = {The mouse will play a pivotal role in mammalian gene function studies as we enter the post-genomics era. The challenge is to develop systematic, genome-wide mutagenesis approaches to the study of gene function. The current mouse mutant resource has been an important source of human genetic disease models. However, despite an apparently large catalogue of mouse mutations, we have access to mutations at only a small fraction of the likely total number of mammalian genes-there is a phenotype gap that needs to be filled by the establishment of new mutagenesis programmes. Two routes, genotype- and phenotype-driven, can be used for the recovery of novel mouse mutations. For the former, gene trap embryonic stem cell libraries appear set to deliver a large number of mutations around the mouse genome. The advantage of genotype-driven approaches is the ease of identification of the mutated locus; the disadvantage that a priori assumptions have to be made concerning the function and likely phenotype of the mutated gene. In contrast, phenotype-driven mutagenesis emphasizes the recovery of novel phenotypes. One phenotype-driven approach that will play an important role in expanding the mouse mutant resource employs the mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). The phenotype-driven route makes no assumptions about the underlying genes involved, and ENU mutagenesis programmes can be expected to play a significant role in uncovering novel pathways and genes; the disadvantage is that the identification of the mutant gene is still not trivial. Together, the complementary routes of genotype- and phenotype-driven mutagenesis will provide a much enlarged catalogue of mouse mutations and phenotypes for future gene function studies.},

Postmortem and structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have highlighted the frontal lobes, amygdala and cerebellum as pathological in autism. However, there is no clear and consistent pathology that has emerged for autism. Moreover, recent studies emphasize that the time course of brain development rather than the final product is most disturbed in autism. We suggest that the heterogeneity of both the core and co-morbid features predicts a heterogeneous pattern of neuropathology in autism. Defined phenotypes in larger samples of children and well-characterized brain tissue will be necessary for clarification of the neuroanatomy of autism.},

	abstract = {Summary Anatomy is the structure of biological organisms. The term also denotes the scientific discipline devoted to the study of anatomical entities and the structural and developmental relations that obtain among these entities during the lifespan of an organism. Anatomical entities are the independent continuants of biomedical reality on which physiological and disease processes depend, and which, in response to etiological agents, can transform themselves into pathological entities. For these reasons, hard copy and in silico information resources in virtually all fields of biology and medicine, as a rule, make extensive reference to anatomical entities. Because of the lack of a generalizable, computable representation of anatomy, developers of computable terminologies and ontologies in clinical medicine and biomedical research represented anatomy from their own more or less divergent viewpoints. The resulting heterogeneity presents a formidable impediment to correlating human anatomy not only across computational resources but also with the anatomy of model organisms used in biomedical experimentation. The Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) ontology is being developed to fill the need for a generalizable anatomy ontology, which can be used and adapted by any computer-based application that requires anatomical information. Moreover it is evolving into a standard reference for divergent views of anatomy and a template for representing the anatomy of animals. A distinction is made between the FMA ontology as a theory of anatomy and the implementation of this theory as the FMA artifact. In either sense of the term, the FMA is a spatial-structural ontology of the entities and relations which together form the phenotypic structure of the human organism at all biologically salient levels of granularity. Making use of explicit ontological principles and sound methods, it is designed to be understandable by human beings and navigable by computers. The FMA’s ontological structure provides for machine-based inference, enabling powerful computational tools of the future to reason with biomedical data.},

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.},

Mouse models with face validity to the core symptoms offer an experimental approach to test hypotheses about the causes of autism and translational tools to evaluate potential treatments. We discovered that the inbred mouse strain BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) incorporates multiple behavioral phenotypes relevant to all three diagnostic symptoms of autism. BTBR displayed selectively reduced social approach, low reciprocal social interactions and impaired juvenile play, as compared with C57BL/6J (B6) controls. Impaired social transmission of food preference in BTBR suggests communication deficits. Repetitive behaviors appeared as high levels of self-grooming by juvenile and adult BTBR mice. Comprehensive analyses of procedural abilities confirmed that social recognition and olfactory abilities were normal in BTBR, with no evidence for high anxiety-like traits or motor impairments, supporting an interpretation of highly specific social deficits. Database comparisons between BTBR and B6 on 124 putative autism candidate genes showed several interesting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BTBR genetic background, including a nonsynonymous coding region polymorphism in Kmo. The Kmo gene encodes kynurenine 3-hydroxylase, an enzyme-regulating metabolism of kynurenic acid, a glutamate antagonist with neuroprotective actions. Sequencing confirmed this coding SNP in Kmo, supporting further investigation into the contribution of this polymorphism to autism-like behavioral phenotypes. Robust and selective social deficits, repetitive self-grooming, genetic stability and commercial availability of the BTBR inbred strain encourage its use as a research tool to search for background genes relevant to the etiology of autism, and to explore therapeutics to treat the core symptoms.},

	abstract = {The two highly related PAR basic region leucine zipper proteins TEF and DBP accumulate according to a robust circadian rhythm in liver and kidney. In liver nuclei, the amplitude of daily oscillation has been estimated to be 50-fold and 160-fold for TEF and DBP, respectively. While DBP mRNA expression is the principal determinant of circadian DBP accumulation, the amplitude of TEF mRNA cycling is insufficient to explain circadian TEF fluctuation. Conceivably, daily variations in TEF degradation or nuclear translocation efficiency may explain the discrepancy between mRNA and protein accumulation. In vitro, TEF and DBP bind the same DNA sequences. Yet, in co-transfection experiments, these two proteins exhibit different activation potentials for two reporter genes examined. While TEF stimulates transcription from the albumin promoter more potently than DBP, only DBP is capable of activating transcription efficiently from the cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase (C7alphaH) promoter. However, a TEF-DBP fusion protein, carrying N-terminal TEF sequences and the DNA binding/dimerization domain of DBP, enhances expression of the C7alphaH-CAT reporter gene as strongly as wild-type DBP. Our results suggest that the promoter environment, rather than the affinity with which PAR proteins recognize their cognate DNA sequences in vitro, determines the promoter preferences of TEF and DBP.},

	abstract = {We have identified and characterized a new member of the leucine zipper (bZIP) gene family of transcription factors, thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF). Analysis of the ontogeny of TEF gene expression reveals the presence of TEF transcripts, beginning on embryonic day 14, only in the region of the rat anterior pituitary gland in which thyrotrophs arise. This pattern of gene expression corresponds temporally and spatially to the onset of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH beta) gene expression, which defines the thyrotroph phenotype. Coupled with this observation, we find that TEF can bind to and trans-activate the TSH beta promoter. In contrast to this restricted pattern of expression during embryogenesis, TEF transcripts appear in several tissues in the mature organism. We propose that TEF belongs to a new class of bZIP proteins on the basis of the unique homology between TEF and another member of the bZIP gene family, the albumin D box-binding protein (DBP). TEF and DBP transcripts are coexpressed in a pituitary cell line, and these two proteins can readily form heterodimers. The DNA-binding and dimerization domains of TEF correspond to those found in other bZIP proteins. We have however, identified a cluster of basic amino acids, found only in TEF and DBP, that is necessary for the proper DNA-binding site specificity of TEF. A major trans-activation domain of TEF resides outside the region of homology to other bZIP proteins. These data are consistent with a role for a member of a new class of bZIP transcription factors in activating gene expression in the developing thyrotroph.},

Here we report that the targeted disruption of Nocturnin (Ccrn4l) in mice, a gene that encodes a circadian deadenylase, confers resistance to diet-induced obesity. Mice lacking Nocturnin remain lean on high-fat diets, with lower body weight and reduced visceral fat. However, unlike lean lipodystrophic mouse models, these mice do not have fatty livers and do not exhibit increased activity or reduced food intake. Gene expression data suggest that Nocturnin knockout mice have deficits in lipid metabolism or uptake, in addition to changes in glucose and insulin sensitivity. Our data support a pivotal role for Nocturnin downstream of the circadian clockwork in the posttranscriptional regulation of genes necessary for nutrient uptake, metabolism, and storage.},

	abstract = {Although CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers have been implicated in transcriptional regulation of several rhythmic genes in vitro through E-box sequence elements, little is known about how the circadian clock regulates rhythmic genes with diverse phases in vivo. The gene nocturnin is rhythmically transcribed in Xenopus retinal photoreceptor cells, which contain endogenous circadian clocks. Transcription of nocturnin peaks in these cells in the middle of the night, while CLOCK/BMAL1 activity peaks during the early morning. We have identified a novel protein-binding motif within the nocturnin promoter, which we designated the nocturnin element (NE). Although the NE sequence closely resembles an E-box, our data show that it functions as a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) by binding CREB. Furthermore, phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) levels are rhythmic in Xenopus photoreceptors, with a phase similar to that of nocturnin transcription. Our results suggest that P-CREB controls the rhythmic regulation of nocturnin transcription and perhaps that of other night phase genes. The NE may be an evolutionary intermediate between the E-box and CRE sequences, both of which seem to be involved in the circadian control of transcription, but have evolved to drive transcription with different phases in these clock-containing cells.},

Fbxl21(-/-) mice exhibited normal periodicity of wheel-running rhythms with compromised organization of daily activities, while an extremely long-period phenotype of Fbxl3(-/-) mice was attenuated in Fbxl3/Fbxl21 double-knockout mice. The double knockout destabilized the behavioral rhythms progressively and sometimes elicited arrhythmicity. Surprisingly, FBXL21 stabilized CRYs and antagonized the destabilizing action by FBXL3. Predominantly cytosolic distribution of FBXL21 contrasts with nuclear localization of FBXL3. These results emphasize the physiological importance of antagonizing actions between FBXL21 and FBXL3 on CRYs, and their combined actions at different subcellular locations stabilize oscillation of the circadian clock.},

	abstract = {Summary
Period determination in the mammalian circadian clock involves the turnover rate of the repressors CRY and PER. We show that CRY ubiquitination engages two competing E3 ligase complexes that either lengthen or shorten circadian period in mice. Cloning of a short-period circadian mutant, Past-time, revealed a glycine to glutamate missense mutation in Fbxl21, an F-box protein gene that is a paralog of Fbxl3 that targets the CRY proteins for degradation. While loss of function of FBXL3 leads to period lengthening, mutation of Fbxl21 causes period shortening. FBXL21 forms an SCF E3 ligase complex that slowly degrades CRY in the cytoplasm but antagonizes the stronger E3 ligase activity of FBXL3 in the nucleus. FBXL21 plays a dual role: protecting CRY from FBXL3 degradation in the nucleus and promoting CRY degradation within the cytoplasm. Thus, the balance and cellular compartmentalization of competing E3 ligases for CRY determine circadian period of the clock in mammals.},

These cell-autonomous clocks are composed of a transcription–translation-based autoregulatory feedback loop. With the development of next-generation sequencing approaches, biochemical and genomic insights into circadian function have recently come into focus. Genome-wide analyses of the clock transcriptional feedback loop have revealed a global circadian regulation of processes such as transcription factor occupancy, RNA polymerase II recruitment and initiation, nascent transcription, and chromatin remodelling. The genomic targets of circadian clocks are pervasive and are intimately linked to the regulation of metabolism, cell growth and physiology.

We estimate that LGD mutation in about 400 genes can contribute to the joint class of affected females and males of lower IQ, with an overlapping and similar number of genes vulnerable to contributory missense mutation. LGD targets in the joint class overlap with published targets for intellectual disability and schizophrenia, and are enriched for chromatin modifiers, FMRP-associated genes and embryonically expressed genes.

	abstract = {It is well established that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a strong genetic component; however, for at least 70\% of cases, the underlying genetic cause is unknown. Under the hypothesis that de novo mutations underlie a substantial fraction of the risk for developing ASD in families with no previous history of ASD or related phenotypes--so-called sporadic or simplex families--we sequenced all coding regions of the genome (the exome) for parent-child trios exhibiting sporadic ASD, including 189 new trios and 20 that were previously reported. Additionally, we also sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected siblings corresponding to these new (n = 31) and previously reported trios (n = 19), for a total of 677 individual exomes from 209 families. Here we show that de novo point mutations are overwhelmingly paternal in origin (4:1 bias) and positively correlated with paternal age, consistent with the modest increased risk for children of older fathers to develop ASD. Moreover, 39\% (49 of 126) of the most severe or disruptive de novo mutations map to a highly interconnected β-catenin/chromatin remodelling protein network ranked significantly for autism candidate genes. In proband exomes, recurrent protein-altering mutations were observed in two genes: CHD8 and NTNG1. Mutation screening of six candidate genes in 1,703 ASD probands identified additional de novo, protein-altering mutations in GRIN2B, LAMC3 and SCN1A. Combined with copy number variant (CNV) data, these results indicate extreme locus heterogeneity but also provide a target for future discovery, diagnostics and therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Multiple studies have confirmed the contribution of rare de novo copy number variations to the risk for autism spectrum disorders. But whereas de novo single nucleotide variants have been identified in affected individuals, their contribution to risk has yet to be clarified. Specifically, the frequency and distribution of these mutations have not been well characterized in matched unaffected controls, and such data are vital to the interpretation of de novo coding mutations observed in probands. Here we show, using whole-exome sequencing of 928 individuals, including 200 phenotypically discordant sibling pairs, that highly disruptive (nonsense and splice-site) de novo mutations in brain-expressed genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders and carry large effects. On the basis of mutation rates in unaffected individuals, we demonstrate that multiple independent de novo single nucleotide variants in the same gene among unrelated probands reliably identifies risk alleles, providing a clear path forward for gene discovery. Among a total of 279 identified de novo coding mutations, there is a single instance in probands, and none in siblings, in which two independent nonsense variants disrupt the same gene, SCN2A (sodium channel, voltage-gated, type II, α subunit), a result that is highly unlikely by chance.},

	abstract = {Evidence for the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has consistently pointed to a strong genetic component complicated by substantial locus heterogeneity. We sequenced the exomes of 20 individuals with sporadic ASD (cases) and their parents, reasoning that these families would be enriched for de novo mutations of major effect. We identified 21 de novo mutations, 11 of which were protein altering. Protein-altering mutations were significantly enriched for changes at highly conserved residues. We identified potentially causative de novo events in 4 out of 20 probands, particularly among more severely affected individuals, in FOXP1, GRIN2B, SCN1A and LAMC3. In the FOXP1 mutation carrier, we also observed a rare inherited CNTNAP2 missense variant, and we provide functional support for a multi-hit model for disease risk. Our results show that trio-based exome sequencing is a powerful approach for identifying new candidate genes for ASDs and suggest that de novo mutations may contribute substantially to the genetic etiology of ASDs.},

	abstract = {Synchronous oscillations of thousands of cellular clocks in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the circadian centre, are coordinated by precisely timed cell-cell communication, the principle of which is largely unknown. Here we show that the amount of RGS16 (regulator of G protein signalling 16), a protein known to inactivate Gαi, increases at a selective circadian time to allow time-dependent activation of intracellular cyclic AMP signalling in the SCN. Gene ablation of Rgs16 leads to the loss of circadian production of cAMP and as a result lengthens circadian period of behavioural rhythm. The temporally precise regulation of the cAMP signal by clock-controlled RGS16 is needed for the dorsomedial SCN to maintain a normal phase-relationship to the ventrolateral SCN. Thus, RGS16-dependent temporal regulation of intracellular G protein signalling coordinates the intercellular synchrony of SCN pacemaker neurons and thereby defines the 24 h rhythm in behaviour.},

	doi = {10.1074/jbc.M502862200},
	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are controlled by the periodic accumulation of Period proteins, which act as transcriptional repressors of Clock-dependent genes. Period genes are themselves Clock targets, thereby establishing a negative transcriptional feedback circuit controlling circadian periodicity. Previous data have implicated the CK1epsilon isolog Doubletime (Dbt) and the F-box protein Slimb in the regulation of Drosophila Period (Per) through an unknown mechanism. In this work, we have identified components of the machinery involved in regulating the abundance of human Per1 in tissue culture cells. CK1epsilon and CK1gamma2 were found to bind to Per1 and to promote its degradation in an in vivo degradation assay. Per1 turnover was blocked by a dominant negative version of the Cul1 protein, a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase. We screened a panel of F-box proteins for those that would associate with Per1 in a CK1epsilon-dependent manner, and we identified beta-TRCP1 and beta-TRCP2, isologs of the Drosophila Slimb protein. RNA interference against beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TRCP) stabilizes endogenous and exogenous Per1. beta-TRCP associates with sequences near the N terminus of Per1 in a region distinct from the previously characterized CK1epsilon-binding site. beta-TRCP and CK1epsilon promote Per1 ubiquitination in vitro. Finally, RNA interference against beta-TRCP greatly decreases Clock-dependent gene expression in tissue culture cells, indicating that beta-TRCP controls endogenous Per1 activity and the circadian clock by directly targeting Per1 for degradation.},

We evaluated the efficiency of AgreementMakerLight in two OAEI tracks: Anatomy and Large Biomedical Ontologies, obtaining excellent run time results. In addition, for the Anatomy track, AgreementMakerLight is now the best system as measured in terms of F-measure. Also in terms of F-measure, AgreementMakerLight is competitive with the best OAEI performers in two of the three tasks of the Large Biomedical Ontologies track that match whole ontologies.},

While each of these features enables applications that facilitate data integration, data access and analysis, a great potential lies in the possibility of combining these four features to support integrative analysis and interpretation of multimodal data. Here, we provide a functional perspective on ontologies in biology and biomedicine, focusing on what ontologies can do and describing how they can be used in support of integrative research.

	abstract = {Endophenotypes, measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype, have emerged as an important concept in the study of complex neuropsychiatric diseases. An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological (including configured self-report data) in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward—and successful—genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters. In addition to furthering genetic analysis, endophenotypes can clarify classification and diagnosis and foster the development of animal models. The authors discuss the etymology and strategy behind the use of endophenotypes in neuropsychiatric research and, more generally, in research on other diseases with complex genetics.},

This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

One branch of machine learning, kernel methods, lends itself particularly well to the difficult aspects of biological data, which include high dimensionality (as in microarray measurements), representation as discrete and structured data (as in DNA or amino acid sequences), and the need to combine heterogeneous sources of information. This book provides a detailed overview of current research in kernel methods and their applications to computational biology.Following three introductory chapters -- an introduction to molecular and computational biology, a short review of kernel methods that focuses on intuitive concepts rather than technical details, and a detailed survey of recent applications of kernel methods in computational biology -- the book is divided into three sections that reflect three general trends in current research. The first part presents different ideas for the design of kernel functions specifically adapted to various biological data; the second part covers different approaches to learning from heterogeneous data; and the third part offers examples of successful applications of support vector machine methods.},

Three-dimensional extensions of these atlases have been developed as well. All two- and three-dimensional atlases are mutually preregistered and may be interactively registered with an actual patient's data. An atlas-based neuroimaging system has been developed that provides support for reformatting, registration, visualization, navigation, image processing, and quantification of clinical data. The anatomical index contains about 1,000 structures and over 400 sulcal patterns. Several new applications of the brain atlas database also have been developed, supported by various technologies such as virtual reality, the Internet, and electronic publishing. Fusion of information from multiple atlases assists the user in comprehensively understanding brain structures and identifying and quantifying anatomical regions in clinical data. The multiple brain atlas database and atlas-based neuroimaging system have substantial potential impact in stereotactic neurosurgery and radiotherapy by assisting in visualization and real-time manipulation in three dimensions of anatomical structures, in quantitative neuroradiology by allowing interactive analysis of clinical data, in three-dimensional neuroeducation, and in brain function studies.},

Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of {\textasciitilde}900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topography— the closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function.},

Overall, transcriptome-based relationships were related to spatial proximity, being strongest between neighboring cortical areas and between proximal layers. Primary visual cortex (V1) displayed the most distinctive gene expression compared to other cortical regions in rhesus and human, both in the specialized layer 4 as well as other layers.

These data reveal diverse gene expression patterns and remarkable conservation of each individual gene's expression among individuals (95\%), cortical areas (84\%), and between human and mouse (79\%). A small but substantial number of genes (21\%) exhibited species-differential expression. Distinct molecular signatures, comprised of genes both common between species and unique to each, were identified for each major cortical cell type. The data suggest that gene expression profile changes may contribute to differential cortical function across species, and in particular, a shift from corticosubcortical to more predominant corticocortical communications in the human brain.},

Because such neurons have been reported in diverse publications without controlled format, it is not easy to keep track of all the known neurons in a particular nervous system. To address this issue we constructed an online database called Flybrain Neuron Database (Flybrain NDB), which serves as a platform to collect and provide information about all the types of neurons published so far in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster. Projection patterns of the identified neurons in diverse areas of the brain were recorded in a unified format, with text-based descriptions as well as images and movies wherever possible. In some cases projection sites and the distribution of the post- and presynaptic sites were determined with greater detail than described in the original publication. Information about the labeling patterns of various antibodies and expression driver strains to visualize identified neurons are provided as a separate sub-database. We also implemented a novel visualization tool with which users can interactively examine three-dimensional reconstruction of the confocal serial section images with desired viewing angles and cross sections. Comprehensive collection and versatile search function of the anatomical information reported in diverse publications make it possible to analyze possible connectivity between different brain regions. We analyzed the preferential connectivity among optic lobe layers and the plausible olfactory sensory map in the lateral horn to show the usefulness of such a database.},

	abstract = {The long history of neuroscience has accumulated information about numerous types of neurons in the brain of various organisms. Because such neurons have been reported in diverse publications without controlled format, it is not easy to keep track of all the known neurons in a particular nervous system. To address this issue we constructed an online database called Flybrain Neuron Database (Flybrain NDB), which serves as a platform to collect and provide information about all the types of neurons published so far in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster. Projection patterns of the identified neurons in diverse areas of the brain were recorded in a unified format, with text-based descriptions as well as images and movies wherever possible. In some cases projection sites and the distribution of the post- and presynaptic sites were determined with greater detail than described in the original publication. Information about the labeling patterns of various antibodies and expression driver strains to visualize identified neurons are provided as a separate sub-database. We also implemented a novel visualization tool with which users can interactively examine three-dimensional reconstruction of the confocal serial section images with desired viewing angles and cross sections. Comprehensive collection and versatile search function of the anatomical information reported in diverse publications make it possible to analyze possible connectivity between different brain regions. We analyzed the preferential connectivity among optic lobe layers and the plausible olfactory sensory map in the lateral horn to show the usefulness of such a database.},

Over the last two years we redeveloped major components of the Reactome web interface to improve usability, responsiveness and data visualization. A new pathway diagram viewer provides a faster, clearer interface and smooth zooming from the entire reaction network to the details of individual reactions. Tool performance for analysis of user datasets has been substantially improved, now generating detailed results for genome-wide expression datasets within seconds. The analysis module can now be accessed through a RESTFul interface, facilitating its inclusion in third party applications. A new overview module allows the visualization of analysis results on a genome-wide Reactome pathway hierarchy using a single screen page. The search interface now provides auto-completion as well as a faceted search to narrow result lists efficiently.},

In this contribution, we focus on the first three items, and, in particular, on the development of a new method for the hierarchical genome-wide and ontology-wide gene function prediction. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the “true path rule” (TPR) that governs both the Gene Ontology and FunCat taxonomies. According to this rule, the proposed TPR ensemble method is characterized by a two-way asymmetric flow of information that traverses the graph-structured ensemble: positive predictions for a node influence in a recursive way its ancestors, while negative predictions influence its offsprings. Cross-validated results with the model organism S. Crevisiae, using seven different sources of biomolecular data, and a theoretical analysis of the the TPR algorithm show the effectiveness and the drawbacks of the proposed approach.},

By comparing with the human genome, we not only confirm substantial conservation in the newly annotated potential functional sequences, but also find a large degree of divergence of sequences involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin state and higher order chromatin organization. Our results illuminate the wide range of evolutionary forces acting on genes and their regulatory regions, and provide a general resource for research into mammalian biology and mechanisms of human diseases.},

Classic methods based on Fourier theory are often hampered by the complex and unpredictable characteristics of experimental and biological noise. Robust nonparametric methods are available but are limited to specific wave forms. We present RAIN, a robust nonparametric method for the detection of rhythms of prespecified periods in biological data that can detect arbitrary wave forms. When applied to measurements of the circadian transcriptome and proteome of mouse liver, the sets of transcripts and proteins with rhythmic abundances were significantly expanded due to the increased detection power, when we controlled for false discovery. Validation against independent data confirmed the quality of these results. The large expansion of the circadian mouse liver transcriptomes and proteomes reflected the prevalence of nonsymmetric wave forms and led to new conclusions about function. RAIN was implemented as a freely available software package for R/Bioconductor and is presently also available as a web interface.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are controlled by the periodic accumulation of Period proteins, which act as transcriptional repressors of Clock-dependent genes. Period genes are themselves Clock targets, thereby establishing a negative transcriptional feedback circuit controlling circadian periodicity. Previous data have implicated the CK1epsilon isolog Doubletime (Dbt) and the F-box protein Slimb in the regulation of Drosophila Period (Per) through an unknown mechanism. In this work, we have identified components of the machinery involved in regulating the abundance of human Per1 in tissue culture cells. CK1epsilon and CK1gamma2 were found to bind to Per1 and to promote its degradation in an in vivo degradation assay. Per1 turnover was blocked by a dominant negative version of the Cul1 protein, a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase. We screened a panel of F-box proteins for those that would associate with Per1 in a CK1epsilon-dependent manner, and we identified beta-TRCP1 and beta-TRCP2, isologs of the Drosophila Slimb protein. RNA interference against beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TRCP) stabilizes endogenous and exogenous Per1. beta-TRCP associates with sequences near the N terminus of Per1 in a region distinct from the previously characterized CK1epsilon-binding site. beta-TRCP and CK1epsilon promote Per1 ubiquitination in vitro. Finally, RNA interference against beta-TRCP greatly decreases Clock-dependent gene expression in tissue culture cells, indicating that beta-TRCP controls endogenous Per1 activity and the circadian clock by directly targeting Per1 for degradation.},

	abstract = {Author Summary In mammals, circadian clocks are based on a core transcriptional–translational feedback loop. BMAL1 and CLOCK activate the transcription of Per1-3 and Cry1/2. PER and CRY proteins inhibit BMAL1/CLOCK, and thus their own transcription. In Clock-/- mice, NPAS2 can substitute for CLOCK in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the major circadian pacemaker. However, peripheral tissues of Clock-/- mice were reported to lack circadian rhythms. Since then, the protein CLOCK has been deemed essential for circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues. However, here we show that Clock-/- peripheral cells and tissues exhibit stable, autonomous circadian rhythms. Furthermore, in Clock-/- fibroblasts, knockdown of Npas2 leads to arrhythmicity, suggesting that NPAS2 can compensate for the loss of CLOCK in peripheral cells as well as in SCN. Our data overturn the notion of an SCN-specific role for NPAS2, and instead indicate that the core loops of SCN neuron and peripheral cell circadian clocks are fundamentally similar. This finding redefines a basic principle of molecular circadian clock regulation in peripheral organs which are essential for many metabolic processes. Disturbances of these rhythms lead to disorders like diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of peripheral circadian oscillators is essential to develop treatments against clock-related disorders.},

Identifying genes and pathways that contribute to differences in neurobehavioural traits is a key goal in psychiatric research. Despite considerable success in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with behaviour in laboratory rodents, pinpointing the causal variants and genes is more challenging. For a long time, the main obstacle was the size of QTLs, which could encompass tens if not hundreds of genes. However, recent studies have exploited mouse and rat resources that allow mapping of phenotypes to narrow intervals, encompassing only a few genes. Here, we review these studies, showcase the rodent resources they have used and highlight the insights into neurobehavioural traits provided to date. We discuss what we see as the biggest challenge in the field – translating QTLs into biological knowledge by experimentally validating and functionally characterizing candidate genes – and propose that the CRISPR/Cas genome-editing system holds the key to overcoming this obstacle. Finally, we challenge traditional views on inbred versus outbred resources in the light of recent resource and technology developments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Published studies suggest associations between circadian gene polymorphisms and bipolar I disorder (BPI), as well as schizoaffective disorder (SZA) and schizophrenia (SZ). The results are plausible, based on prior studies of circadian abnormalities. As replications have not been attempted uniformly, we evaluated representative, common polymorphisms in all three disorders.
METHODS: We assayed 276 publicly available 'tag' single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 21 circadian genes among 523 patients with BPI, 527 patients with SZ/SZA, and 477 screened adult controls. Detected associations were evaluated in relation to two published genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
RESULTS: Using gene-based tests, suggestive associations were noted between EGR3 and BPI (p = 0.017), and between NPAS2 and SZ/SZA (p = 0.034). Three SNPs were associated with both sets of disorders (NPAS2: rs13025524 and rs11123857; RORB: rs10491929; p {\textless} 0.05). None of the associations remained significant following corrections for multiple comparisons. Approximately 15\% of the analyzed SNPs overlapped with an independent study that conducted GWAS for BPI; suggestive overlap between the GWAS analyses and ours was noted at ARNTL.
CONCLUSIONS: Several suggestive, novel associations were detected with circadian genes and BPI and SZ/SZA, but the present analyses do not support associations with common polymorphisms that confer risk with odds ratios greater than 1.5. Additional analyses using adequately powered samples are warranted to further evaluate these results.},

A recent study reported that SIRT1 is a molecule that plays an important role in the circadian clock system. Therefore, to evaluate the association among the SIRT1 gene, schizophrenia and BP, we conducted a case-control study of Japanese population samples (1158 schizophrenia patients, 1008 BP patients and 2127 controls) with four tagging SNPs (rs12778366, rs2273773, rs4746720 and rs10997875) in the SIRT1 gene. Marker-trait association analysis was used to evaluate the allele and the genotype association with the χ(2) test, and haplotype association analysis was evaluated with a likelihood ratio test. We showed an association between rs4746720 in the SIRT1 gene and schizophrenia in the allele and the genotype analysis. However, the significance of these associations did not survive after Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing. On the other hand, the SIRT1 gene was associated with Japanese schizophrenia in a haplotype-wise analysis (global P(all markers) = 4.89 × 10(-15)). Also, four tagging SNPs in the SIRT1 gene were not associated with BP. In conclusion, the SIRT1 gene may play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in the Japanese population.},

	abstract = {Progress in unravelling the cellular and molecular basis of mammalian circadian regulation over the past decade has provided us with new avenues through which we can explore central nervous system disease. Deteriorations in measurable circadian output parameters, such as sleep/wake deficits and dysregulation of circulating hormone levels, are common features of most central nervous system disorders. At the core of the mammalian circadian system is a complex of molecular oscillations within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus. These oscillations are modifiable by afferent signals from the environment, and integrated signals are subsequently conveyed to remote central neural circuits where specific output rhythms are regulated. Mutations in circadian genes in mice can disturb both molecular oscillations and measurable output rhythms. Moreover, systematic analysis of these mutants indicates that they can express an array of abnormal behavioural phenotypes that are intermediate signatures of central nervous system disorders. Furthermore, the response of these mutants to psychoactive drugs suggests that clock genes can modify a number of the brain’s critical neurotransmitter systems. This evidence has led to promising investigations into clock gene polymorphisms in psychiatric disease. Preliminary indications favour the systematic investigation of the contribution of circadian genes to central nervous system disease.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: In neuroscience, as in many other scientific domains, the primary form of knowledge dissemination is through published articles. One challenge for modern neuroinformatics is finding methods to make the knowledge from the tremendous backlog of publications accessible for search, analysis and the integration of such data into computational models. A key example of this is metascale brain connectivity, where results are not reported in a normalized repository. Instead, these experimental results are published in natural language, scattered among individual scientific publications. This lack of normalization and centralization hinders the large-scale integration of brain connectivity results. In this article, we present text-mining models to extract and aggregate brain connectivity results from 13.2 million PubMed abstracts and 630 216 full-text publications related to neuroscience. The brain regions are identified with three different named entity recognizers (NERs) and then normalized against two atlases: the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) and the atlas from the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS). We then use three different extractors to assess inter-region connectivity.
RESULTS: NERs and connectivity extractors are evaluated against a manually annotated corpus. The complete in litero extraction models are also evaluated against in vivo connectivity data from ABA with an estimated precision of 78\%. The resulting database contains over 4 million brain region mentions and over 100 000 (ABA) and 122 000 (BAMS) potential brain region connections. This database drastically accelerates connectivity literature review, by providing a centralized repository of connectivity data to neuroscientists.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most prevalent and highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. There is significant evidence that the onset and severity of ASD is governed in part by complex genetic mechanisms affecting the normal development of the brain. To date, a number of genes have been associated with ASD. However, the temporal and spatial co-expression of these genes in the brain remain unclear. To address this issue, we examined the co-expression network of 26 autism genes from AutDB (http://mindspec.org/autdb.html), in the framework of 3,041 genes whose expression energies have the highest correlation between the coronal and sagittal images from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas database (http://mouse.brain-map.org). These data were derived from in situ hybridization experiments conducted on male, 56-day old C57BL/6J mice co-registered to the Allen Reference Atlas, and were used to generate a normalized co-expression matrix indicating the cosine similarity between expression vectors of genes in this database. The network formed by the autism-associated genes showed a higher degree of co-expression connectivity than seen for the other genes in this dataset (Kolmogorov–Smirnov P = 5×10−28). Using Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two cliques of co-expressed genes that were significantly enriched with autism genes (A Bonferroni corrected P{\textless}0.05). Genes in both these cliques were significantly over-expressed in the cerebellar cortex (P = 1×10−5) suggesting possible implication of this brain region in autism. In conclusion, our study provides a detailed profiling of co-expression patterns of autism genes in the mouse brain, and suggests specific brain regions and new candidate genes that could be involved in autism etiology., Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition associated with many different genes. However, the neuroanatomical and functional properties of these genes in the brain are largely unknown. Here we examined the co-expression network of 26 genes associated with ASD, using data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, which provides a whole-genome, high-resolution map of gene expression pattern in the adult mouse brain. We discovered that autism genes are significantly more co-expressed than expected by chance, suggesting common neuro-functional properties. We then examined the spatial properties of co-expression modules that are highly enriched with autism genes. Consequently, we found that genes in two of these modules are significantly over-expressed in the cerebellar cortex, and particularly in sections that are predominantly populated by granular cells. These findings provide the essential link between gene networks associated with ASD and specific brain regions, and hence lay out a basis for further exploration of the particular neuronal circuits involved in ASD etiology.},

First, genetic markers reveal distinct spatial expression domains and subdomains along the longitudinal (dorsal/septal/posterior to ventral/temporal/anterior) axis of field CA1. Second, genetic markers divide field CA1 pyramidal neurons into multiple subtypes with characteristic laminar distributions. And third, subcortical brain regions receiving axonal projections from molecularly distinct spatial domains of field CA1 display distinct global gene expression patterns, suggesting that field CA1 spatial domains may be genetically wired independently to form distinct functional networks related to cognition and emotion.

We identified some 90 genes that are highly expressed in specific subsets of cerebellar cortical inhibitory interneurons or various combinations thereof. Four genes are exclusively expressed, within the cerebellar cortex, in molecular layer interneurons, and ten genes label exclusively inhibitory interneurons in the granule cell layer or subsets thereof. Differential expression of many of these genes in cells residing in the lower versus the upper molecular layer provides evidence that these cells, traditionally referred to as basket and stellate cells, are indeed molecularly distinct. Two genes could be identified as novel markers for unipolar brush cells. Intersection of these data with embryonic expression patterns as documented in the genepaint repository does not support a hierarchical model of cerebellar interneuron development, but may be more easily reconciled with the view that cerebellar inhibitory interneurons derive from a common precursor pool from which they are specified only late into their development. The novel markers identified here should prove useful for probing the timing and mechanisms supporting cerebellar cortical interneuron specification and diversification.},

 Allen Brain Atlas, we systematically and quantitatively analyzed the spatial
 and cellular distribution of 307 Slc genes, which represent nearly
 90\% of presently known mouse Slc genes, in the adult C57BL/6J mouse
 brain. Our analysis showed that 252 (82\%) of the 307 Slc genes are
 present in the brain, and a large proportion of these genes were detected at
 low to moderate expression levels. Evaluation of 20 anatomical brain
 subdivisions demonstrated a comparable level of Slc gene complexity
 but significant difference in transcript enrichment. The distribution of the
 expressed Slc genes was diverse, ranging from near-ubiquitous to
 highly localized. Functional annotation in 20 brain regions, including the
 blood-brain and blood-cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) barriers, suggests major
 roles of Slc transporters in supporting brain energy utilization,
 neurotransmission, nutrient supply, and CSF production. Furthermore,
 hierarchical cluster analysis revealed intricate Slc expression
 patterns associated with neuroanatomical organization. Our studies also
 revealed Slc genes present within defined brain microstructures and
 described the putative cell types expressing individual Slc genes.
 These results provide a useful resource for investigators to explore the roles
 of Slc genes in neurophysiological and pathological processes.},

	abstract = {Background
Many important high throughput projects use in situ hybridization and may require the analysis of images of spatial cross sections of organisms taken with cellular level resolution. Projects creating gene expression atlases at unprecedented scales for the embryonic fruit fly as well as the embryonic and adult mouse already involve the analysis of hundreds of thousands of high resolution experimental images mapping mRNA expression patterns. Challenges include accurate registration of highly deformed tissues, associating cells with known anatomical regions, and identifying groups of genes whose expression is coordinately regulated with respect to both concentration and spatial location. Solutions to these and other challenges will lead to a richer understanding of the complex system aspects of gene regulation in heterogeneous tissue.

Results
We present an end-to-end approach for processing raw in situ expression imagery and performing subsequent analysis. We use a non-linear, information theoretic based image registration technique specifically adapted for mapping expression images to anatomical annotations and a method for extracting expression information within an anatomical region. Our method consists of coarse registration, fine registration, and expression feature extraction steps. From this we obtain a matrix for expression characteristics with rows corresponding to genes and columns corresponding to anatomical sub-structures. We perform matrix block cluster analysis using a novel row-column mixture model and we relate clustered patterns to Gene Ontology (GO) annotations.

Conclusion
Resulting registrations suggest that our method is robust over intensity levels and shape variations in ISH imagery. Functional enrichment studies from both simple analysis and block clustering indicate that gene relationships consistent with biological knowledge of neuronal gene functions can be extracted from large ISH image databases such as the Allen Brain Atlas [] and the Max-Planck Institute [] using our method. While we focus here on imagery and experiments of the mouse brain our approach should be applicable to a variety of in situ experiments.},

RESULTS: aGEM 3.1 (anatomic Gene Expression Mapping) addresses the issues of diversity and heterogeneity of anatomical gene expression databases by integrating six mouse gene expression resources (EMAGE, GXD, GENSAT, Allen Brain Atlas data base, EUREXPRESS and BioGPS) and three human gene expression databases (HUDSEN, Human Protein Atlas and BioGPS). Furthermore, aGEM 3.1 provides new cross analysis tools to bridge these resources.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: aGEM 3.1 can be queried using gene and anatomical structure. Output information is presented in a friendly format, allowing the user to display expression maps and correlation matrices for a gene or structure during development. An in-depth study of a specific developmental stage is also possible using heatmaps that relate gene expression with anatomical components. http://agem.cnb.csic.es

The accumulation of these aggregated proteins signals dysfunction of cellular protein homeostatic mechanisms such as the ubiquitin/proteasome system, autophagy, and the chaperone network. Although there are several published studies in which transcriptional profiling has been used to examine gene expression in various tissues, including tissues of neurodegenerative disease models, there has not been a report that focuses exclusively on expression of the chaperone network. In the present study, we used the Allen Brain Atlas online database to analyze chaperone expression levels. This database utilizes a quantitative in situ hybridization approach and provides data on 270 chaperone genes within many substructures of the adult mouse brain. We determined that 256 of these chaperone genes are expressed at some level. Surprisingly, relatively few genes, only 30, showed significant variations in levels of mRNA across different substructures of the brain. The greatest degree of variability was exhibited by genes of the DnaJ co-chaperone, Tetratricopeptide repeat, and the HSPH families. Our analysis provides a valuable resource towards determining how variations in chaperone gene expression may modulate the vulnerability of specific neuronal populations of mammalian brain.},

However, the function of this so-called PV1 nucleus is unknown. In this article, we report the results of an unbiased, broad and in-depth molecular characterization of this small, compact group of neurons. The Allen Brain Atlas database of in situ hybridization was screened in order to identify genes expressed in the PV1-nucleus-containing area of the hypothalamus, and those that might be co-expressed with parvalbumin. Although GABA is the principal neurotransmitter in parvalbumin-expressing cells in various other brain areas, we found that PV1 neurons express the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) VGlut2-encoding gene Slc17a6 and are negative for the glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) gene. These cells also express the mRNA for the neuropeptides Adcyap1 and possibly Nxph4, express several types of potassium and sodium channels, are under the control of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, bear receptors for the glial-derived neurotrophic factor, and produce an extracellular matrix rich in osteopontin. The PV1 nucleus is thus composed of glutamatergic nerve cells, expressing some typical markers of long-axon, projecting neurons (e.g. VGlut2), but also co-expressing genes typical of short-axon GABA neurons (e.g. a variety of potassium channels). Hence, neurons of the PV1 nucleus combine physiological characteristics of interneurons with those of projection neurons.},

In order to understand how these properties may be generated, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in the DR using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. Since DR cytoarchitecture is organized with respect to the midline, we sought to identify genes that were expressed in a pattern with respect to the midline, either enriched or depleted, rather than those that were homogenously expressed throughout the DR. Less than 10\% of the screened genes for voltage-gated ion channels showed patterned expression within the DR. Identified genes included voltage-gated sodium channel beta subunits, potassium channels, P/Q-, N-type calcium channels, as well as the alpha2/delta-1 calcium channel. Several voltage-gated chloride channels were also identified, although these may function within intracellular compartments. Of the ligand-gated ion channels examined, 20\% showed patterned expression. These consisted primarily of glutamate and GABA-A receptor subunits. The identified genes likely contribute to unique excitable properties of different groups of neurons in the DR and may include novel pharmacologic targets for affective disorders.},

	abstract = {Rodent self-grooming is an important, evolutionarily conserved behavior, highly sensitive to pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Mice with aberrant grooming phenotypes are currently used to model various human disorders. Therefore, it is critical to understand the biology of grooming behavior, and to assess its translational validity to humans. The present in-silico study used publicly available gene expression and behavioral data obtained from several inbred mouse strains in the open-field, light-dark box, elevated plus- and elevated zero-maze tests. As grooming duration differed between strains, our analysis revealed several candidate genes with significant correlations between gene expression in the brain and grooming duration. The Allen Brain Atlas, STRING, GoMiner and Mouse Genome Informatics databases were used to functionally map and analyze these candidate mouse genes against their human orthologs, assessing the strain ranking of their expression and the regional distribution of expression in the mouse brain. This allowed us to identify an interconnected network of candidate genes (which have expression levels that correlate with grooming behavior), display altered patterns of expression in key brain areas related to grooming, and underlie important functions in the brain. Collectively, our results demonstrate the utility of large-scale, high-throughput data-mining and in-silico modeling for linking genomic and behavioral data, as well as their potential to identify novel neural targets for complex neurobehavioral phenotypes, including grooming.},

Understanding the human brain, cognition, and disease will require integrating facts from dozens of scientific fields spread amongst millions of studies locked away in static documents, making any such integration daunting, at best. The future of scientific progress will be aided by bridging the gap between the millions of published research articles and modern databases such as the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA). To that end, we have analyzed the text of over 3.5 million scientific abstracts to find associations between neuroscientific concepts. From the literature alone, we show that we can blindly and algorithmically extract a “cognome”: relationships between brain structure, function, and disease. We demonstrate the potential of data-mining and cross-platform data-integration with the ABA by introducing two methods for semiautomated hypothesis generation. By analyzing statistical “holes” and discrepancies in the literature we can find understudied or overlooked research paths. That is, we have added a layer of semi-automation to a part of the scientific process itself. This is an important step toward fundamentally incorporating data-mining algorithms into the scientific method in a manner that is generalizable to any scientific or medical field.},

Images now reveal highly complex patterns of gene expression varying on multiple scales. The challenge in analyzing these images is both in extracting the patterns that are most relevant functionally and in providing a meaningful representation that allows neuroscientists to interpret the extracted patterns., Results: Here, we present FuncISH—a method to learn functional representations of neural in situ hybridization (ISH) images. We represent images using a histogram of local descriptors in several scales, and we use this representation to learn detectors of functional (GO) categories for every image. As a result, each image is represented as a point in a low-dimensional space whose axes correspond to meaningful functional annotations. The resulting representations define similarities between ISH images that can be easily explained by functional categories. We applied our method to the genomic set of mouse neural ISH images available at the Allen Brain Atlas, finding that most neural biological processes can be inferred from spatial expression patterns with high accuracy. Using functional representations, we predict several gene interaction properties, such as protein–protein interactions and cell-type specificity, more accurately than competing methods based on global correlations. We used FuncISH to identify similar expression patterns of GABAergic neuronal markers that were not previously identified and to infer new gene function based on image–image similarities., Contact:

We found that the combined spatial expression patterns of 170 neuron-specific transcripts revealed strikingly clear and symmetrical signatures for most of the brain’s major subdivisions. Moreover, the brain expression spatial signatures correspond to anatomical structures and may even reflect developmental ontogeny. Spatial expression profiles of astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific genes also revealed regional differences; these defined fewer regions and were less distinct but still symmetrical in the coronal plane. Follow-up analysis suggested that region-based clustering of neuron-specific genes was related to (i) a combination of individual genes with restricted expression patterns, (ii) region-specific differences in the relative expression of functional groups of genes, and (iii) regional differences in neuronal density. Products from some of these neuron-specific genes are present in peripheral blood, raising the possibility that they could reflect the activities of disease- or injury-perturbed networks and collectively function as biomarkers for clinical disease diagnostics.},

It provides a framework to explore spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression during development. We employ a graph approximation formulation to cocluster the genes and the brain voxels simultaneously for each time point. We show that this formulation can be expressed as a probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model, thereby allowing us to use the expectation-maximization algorithm for PLSA to estimate the coclustering parameters. To provide a quantitative comparison with prior methods, we evaluate the coclustering method on a set of standard synthetic data sets.

However, systematic studies of this relationship in a single mammalian brain are lacking to date. Here, we investigate this relationship in the mouse brain using the Allen Brain Atlas data. We employ computational models for predicting brain connectivity from gene expression data. In addition to giving competitive predictive performance, these models can rank the genes according to their predictive power. We show that gene expression is predictive of connectivity in the mouse brain when the connectivity signals are discretized. When the expression patterns of 4084 genes are used, we obtain a predictive accuracy of 93\%. Our results also show that a small number of genes can almost give the full predictive power of using thousands of genes. We can achieve a prediction accuracy of 91\% by using only 25 genes. Gene ontology analysis of the highly ranked genes shows that they are enriched for connectivity related processes.},

We propose a computational model using the Allen Atlas to solve this problem, thus estimating previously unidentified cell-type–specific maps of the mouse brain. The model can be used to define brain regions through genetic data., Spatial patterns of gene expression in the vertebrate brain are not independent, as pairs of genes can exhibit complex patterns of coexpression. Two genes may be similarly expressed in one region, but differentially expressed in other regions. These correlations have been studied quantitatively, particularly for the Allen Atlas of the adult mouse brain, but their biological meaning remains obscure. We propose a simple model of the coexpression patterns in terms of spatial distributions of underlying cell types and establish its plausibility using independently measured cell-type–specific transcriptomes.

However, many lack the expertise to correctly annotate the complex anatomy of brain tissue, or have the capacity to analyze the number of animals required in preclinical studies, especially considering the significant variability in sizes of brain regions. To address this issue, we have developed a pipeline to automatically map mass spectrometry imaging data sets of mouse brains to the Allen Brain Reference Atlas, which contains publically available data combining gene expression with brain anatomical locations. Our pipeline enables facile and rapid interanimal comparisons by first testing if each animal’s tissue section was sampled at a similar location and enabling the extraction of the biomolecular signatures from specific brain regions.},

Specifically, results on the worm Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that the prediction of neuronal connectivity using gene expression signatures yielded statistically significant results. Recent studies on the mammalian brain produced similar results at the coarse regional level. In this study, we provide the first high-resolution, large-scale integrative analysis of the transcriptome and connectome in a single mammalian brain at a fine voxel level.

We also identify a set of genes playing the most important role in connectivity prediction. We use only this small number of genes to predict the brain wiring with an accuracy over 80\%.

	abstract = {Neurons of the mammalian neocortex are produced by proliferating cells located in the ventricular zone (VZ) lining the lateral ventricles. This is a complex and sequential process, requiring precise control of cell cycle progression, fate commitment and differentiation. We have analyzed publicly available databases from mouse and human to identify candidate genes that are potentially involved in regulating early neocortical development and neurogenesis. We used a mouse in situ hybridization dataset (The Allen Institute for Brain Science) to identify 13 genes (Cdon, Celsr1, Dbi, E2f5, Eomes, Hmgn2, Neurog2, Notch1, Pcnt, Sox3, Ssrp1, Tead2, Tgif2) with high correlation of expression in the proliferating cells of the VZ of the neocortex at early stages of development (E15.5). We generated a similar human brain network using microarray and RNA-seq data (BrainSpan Atlas) and identified 407 genes with high expression in the developing human VZ and subventricular zone (SVZ) at 8–9 post-conception weeks. Seven of the human genes were also present in the mouse VZ network. The human and mouse networks were extended using available genetic and proteomic datasets through GeneMANIA. A gene ontology search of the mouse and human networks indicated that many of the genes are involved in the cell cycle, DNA replication, mitosis and transcriptional regulation. The reported involvement of Cdon, Celsr1, Dbi, Eomes, Neurog2, Notch1, Pcnt, Sox3, Tead2, and Tgif2 in neural development or diseases resulting from the disruption of neurogenesis validates these candidate genes. Taken together, our knowledge-based discovery method has validated the involvement of many genes already known to be involved in neocortical development and extended the potential number of genes by 100's, many of which are involved in functions related to cell proliferation but others of which are potential candidates for involvement in the regulation of neocortical development.},

Therefore, the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) initiated the development of a spatial framework for neuroscience data integration with an associated Digital Atlasing Infrastructure (DAI). A prototype implementation of this infrastructure for the rodent brain is reported here. The infrastructure is based on a collection of reference spaces to which data is mapped at the required resolution, such as the Waxholm Space (WHS), a 3D reconstruction of the brain generated using high-resolution, multi-channel microMRI. The core standards of the digital atlasing service-oriented infrastructure include Waxholm Markup Language (WaxML): XML schema expressing a uniform information model for key elements such as coordinate systems, transformations, points of interest (POI)s, labels, and annotations; and Atlas Web Services: interfaces for querying and updating atlas data. The services return WaxML-encoded documents with information about capabilities, spatial reference systems (SRSs) and structures, and execute coordinate transformations and POI-based requests. Key elements of INCF-DAI cyberinfrastructure have been prototyped for both mouse and rat brain atlas sources, including the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, UCSD Cell-Centered Database, and Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project.},

	abstract = {Studies of the brain’s transcriptome have become prominent in recent years, resulting in an accumulation of datasets with somewhat distinct attributes. These datasets, which are often analyzed only in isolation, also are often collected with divergent goals, which are reflected in their sampling properties. While many researchers have been interested in sampling gene expression in one or a few brain areas in a large number of subjects, recent efforts from the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences and others have focused instead on dense neuroanatomical sampling, necessarily limiting the number of individual donor brains studied. The purpose of the present work is to develop methods that draw on the complementary strengths of these two types of datasets for study of the human brain, and to characterize the anatomical specificity of gene expression profiles and gene co-expression networks derived from human brains using different specific technologies. The approach is applied using two publicly accessible datasets: (1) the high anatomical resolution Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA, Hawrylycz et al., 2012) and (2) a relatively large sample size, but comparatively coarse neuroanatomical dataset described previously by Gibbs et al. (2010). We found a relatively high degree of correspondence in differentially expressed genes and regional gene expression profiles across the two datasets. Gene co-expression networks defined in individual brain regions were less congruent, but also showed modest anatomical specificity. Using gene modules derived from the Gibbs dataset and from curated gene lists, we demonstrated varying degrees of anatomical specificity based on two classes of methods, one focused on network modularity and the other focused on enrichment of expression levels. Two approaches to assessing the statistical significance of a gene set’s modularity in a given brain region were studied, which provide complementary information about the anatomical specificity of a gene network of interest. Overall, the present work demonstrates the feasibility of cross-dataset analysis of human brain microarray studies, and offers a new approach to annotating gene lists in a neuroanatomical context.},

Several explorative studies have applied linear dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and classical Multi-Dimensional Scaling (cMDS) to gain insight into the spatial organization of these expression patterns. In this paper, we describe a non-linear embedding technique called Barnes-Hut Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-SNE) that emphasizes the local similarity structure of high-dimensional data points. By applying BH-SNE to the gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlases, we demonstrate the consistency of the 2D, non-linear embedding of the sagittal and coronal mouse brain atlases, and across 6 human brains. In addition, we quantitatively show that BH-SNE maps are superior in their separation of neuroanatomical regions in comparison to PCA and cMDS. Finally, we assess the effect of higher-order principal components on the global structure of the BH-SNE similarity maps. Based on our observations, we conclude that BH-SNE maps with or without prior dimensionality reduction (based on PCA) provide comprehensive and intuitive insights in both the local and global spatial transcriptome structure of the human and mouse Allen Brain Atlases.},

	abstract = {Brain tumor is a fatal central nervous system disease that occurs in around
250,000 people each year globally and it is the second cause of cancer in children. It has
been widely acknowledged that genetic factor is one of the significant risk factors for
brain cancer. Thus, accurate descriptions of the locations of where the relative genes are
active and how these genes express are critical for understanding the pathogenesis of
brain tumor and for early detection. The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas is a project
on gene expression over the course of mouse brain development stages. Utilizing mouse
models allows us to use a relatively homogeneous system to reveal the genetic risk factor
of brain cancer. In the Allen atlas, about 435,000 high-resolution spatiotemporal
in situ hybridization images have been generated for approximately
2,100 genes and currently the expression patterns over specific brain regions are manually
annotated by experts, which does not scale with the continuously expanding collection of
images. In this paper, we present an efficient computational approach to perform automated
gene expression pattern annotation on brain images. First, the gene expression information
in the brain images is captured by invariant features extracted from local image patches.
Next, we adopt an augmented sparse coding method, called Stochastic Coordinate Coding, to
construct high-level representations. Different pooling methods are then applied to
generate gene-level features. To discriminate gene expression patterns at specific brain
regions, we employ supervised learning methods to build accurate models for both
binary-class and multi-class cases. Random undersampling and majority voting strategies
are utilized to deal with the inherently imbalanced class distribution within each
annotation task in order to further improve predictive performance. In addition, we
propose a novel structure-based multi-label classification approach, which makes use of
label hierarchy based on brain ontology during model learning. Extensive experiments have
been conducted on the atlas and results show that the proposed approach produces higher
annotation accuracy than several baseline methods. Our approach is shown to be robust on
both binary-class and multi-class tasks and even with a relatively low training ratio. Our
results also show that the use of label hierarchy can significantly improve the annotation
accuracy at all brain ontology levels.},

	abstract = {Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encode an animal’s position and orientation in space. Within the MEC spatial representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell adhesion- and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuroanatomical data. Our results support the hypothesis that differences in gene expression contribute to functional specialization of superficial layers of the MEC and dorsoventral organization of the scale of spatial representations., Higher brain functions such as spatial cognition are carried out in specialized brain areas. Within a specialized brain area nerve cells with different functions are organized in layers and gradients. It is possible that this topographical organization reflects underlying differences in molecular organization of the brain. However, systematic comparison of the expression patterns of tens of thousands of genes at the resolution of layers and borders is challenging. Here we develop a new computational pipeline that addresses this problem. We apply this pipeline to analysis of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), a brain structure that is important for spatial cognition. Our analysis shows that the MEC is highly organized at a molecular level, identifies related groups of genes that might underlie functional specialization, and implicates energy-related genes in vulnerability of certain neuronal populations to neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Our computational pipeline may have general utility for high-throughput and high-resolution analysis of brain anatomy. Our results support the notion that molecular differences contribute to functional specialization of higher cognitive circuits.},

The aim of the present study was to compile a comprehensive atlas of the gene-expression profiles of the entire EF-hand gene superfamily in the murine brain. This was achieved by a meticulous examination of the in-situ hybridization images in the Allen Brain Atlas database. Topographically, our analysis focused on the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex (barrel cortex in the primary somatosensory area), basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, midbrain, pons and medulla, and on clearly identifiable sub-structures within each of these areas. The expression profiles of four family-members, namely hippocalcin-like 4, neurocalcin-δ, plastin 3 and tescalcin, that have not been hitherto reported, at either the mRNA (in-situ-hybridization) or the protein (immunohistochemical) levels, are now presented for the first time. The fruit of our analysis is a document in which the gene-expression profiles of all members of the EF-hand family genes are compared, and in which future possible neuronal markers for specific cells/brain areas are identified.

Clustering methods and principal component analysis were applied to anterograde tract-tracing experiments in mouse available from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. The results revealed a major break in the networks of the DR such that the caudal third of the DR was more similar in afferent innervation to the MR than it was to the rostral two thirds of the DR. The rostral part of the DR is associated with networks controlling motor and motivated behavior, while the caudal DR is more closely aligned with regions that regulate rhythmic hippocampal activity. Thus a major source of heterogeneity within the DR is inclusion of the caudal component, which may be more accurately viewed as a dorsal extension of the MR.},

Such analysis implies that the differentiation of diverse peptidergic cell populations depends on the molecular environment where they are born. Moreover, a number of these peptidergic neurons were observed to migrate radially and/or tangentially, invading different adult locations, often intermingled with other cell types. This suggests that a developmental approach is absolutely necessary for the understanding of their adult distribution. In this essay, we examine comparatively the ontogenetic hypothalamic topography of twelve additional peptidergic populations documented in the Allen Developmental Mouse Brain Atlas, and discuss shared vs. variant aspects in their apparent origins, migrations and final distribution, in the context of the respective genoarchitectonic backgrounds.

	abstract = {Background
Profiling gene expression in brain structures at various spatial and temporal scales is essential to understanding how genes regulate the development of brain structures. The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas provides high-resolution 3-D in situ hybridization (ISH) gene expression patterns in multiple developing stages of the mouse brain. Currently, the ISH images are annotated with anatomical terms manually. In this paper, we propose a computational approach to annotate gene expression pattern images in the mouse brain at various structural levels over the course of development.

Results
We applied deep convolutional neural network that was trained on a large set of natural images to extract features from the ISH images of developing mouse brain. As a baseline representation, we applied invariant image feature descriptors to capture local statistics from ISH images and used the bag-of-words approach to build image-level representations. Both types of features from multiple ISH image sections of the entire brain were then combined to build 3-D, brain-wide gene expression representations. We employed regularized learning methods for discriminating gene expression patterns in different brain structures. Results show that our approach of using convolutional model as feature extractors achieved superior performance in annotating gene expression patterns at multiple levels of brain structures throughout four developing ages. Overall, we achieved average AUC of 0.894 ± 0.014, as compared with 0.820 ± 0.046 yielded by the bag-of-words approach.

Conclusions
Deep convolutional neural network model trained on natural image sets and applied to gene expression pattern annotation tasks yielded superior performance, demonstrating its transfer learning property is applicable to such biological image sets.},

By using the Allen Brain Atlas data, we analyzed the relationship between gene expression and projection targets. We first visualized and clustered the two data sets separately and showed that they both exhibit strong spatial autocorrelation. Building upon this initial analysis, we conducted an integrative correlation analysis of the two data sets while correcting for their spatial autocorrelation. This resulted in a correlation of 0.19 with significant p value. We further identified the top genes responsible for this correlation using two greedy gene ranking techniques. Using only the top genes identified by those techniques, we recomputed the correlation between these two data sets. This led to correlation values up to 0.49 with significant p values. Our results illustrated that although the target specificity of neurons is in fact complex and diverse, yet they are strongly affected by their genetic and molecular compositions.},

Moreover, the expression of these cliques of genes is not homogeneous across the cerebellar cortex, and it has been noted that their expression pattern seems to highlight the granular layer. However, this observation was only made by eye, and recent advances in computational neuroanatomy allow to rank cell types in the mouse brain (characterized by their transcriptome profiles) according to the similarity between their spatial density profiles and the spatial expression profiles of the cliques. We establish by Monte Carlo simulation that with probability at least 99\%, the expression profiles of the two cliques are more similar to the density profile of granule cells than 99\% of the expression of cliques containing the same number of genes (Purkinje cells also score above 99\% in one of the cliques). Thresholding the expression profiles shows that the signal is more intense in the granular layer. Finally, we work out pairs of cell types whose combined expression profiles are more similar to the expression profiles of the cliques than any single cell type. These pairs predominantly consist of one cortical pyramidal cell and one cerebellar cell (which can be either a granule cell or a Purkinje cell).},

We correlated the anxious behavior resulting from the deletion of these genes to their brain expression, using the Allen Brain Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The main finding is that the genes accompanied, after deletion, by a modification of the anxious behavior, have lower expression in the cerebral cortex, the amygdala and the ventral striatum. The lower expression level was putatively due to their selective presence in a neuronal subpopulation. This difference was replicated also using a database of human gene expression, further showing that the differential expression pertained, in humans, a temporal window of young postnatal age (4 months up to 4 years) but was not evident at fetal or adult human stages. Finally, using gene enrichment analysis we also show that presynaptic genes are involved in the emergence of anxiety and postsynaptic genes in the reduction of anxiety after gene deletion.},

	abstract = {Enrichment analysis has been widely applied in the genome-wide association studies, where gene sets corresponding to biological pathways are examined for significant associations with a phenotype to help increase statistical power and improve biological interpretation. In this work, we expand the scope of enrichment analysis into brain imaging genetics, an emerging field that studies how genetic variation influences brain structure and function measured by neuroimaging quantitative traits (QT). Given the high dimensionality of both imaging and genetic data, we propose to study Imaging Genetic Enrichment Analysis (IGEA), a new enrichment analysis paradigm that jointly considers meaningful gene sets (GS) and brain circuits (BC) and examines whether any given GS–BC pair is enriched in a list of gene–QT findings. Using gene expression data from Allen Human Brain Atlas and imaging genetics data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative as test beds, we present an IGEA framework and conduct a proof-of-concept study. This empirical study identifies 25 significant high-level two-dimensional imaging genetics modules. Many of these modules are relevant to a variety of neurobiological pathways or neurodegenerative diseases, showing the promise of the proposal framework for providing insight into the mechanism of complex diseases.},

We describe a high resolution transcriptional atlas of rhesus monkey brain development that combines dense temporal sampling of prenatal and postnatal periods with fine anatomical parcellation of cortical and subcortical regions associated with human neuropsychiatric disease. Gene expression changes more rapidly before birth, both in progenitor cells and maturing neurons, and cortical layers and areas acquire adult-like molecular profiles surprisingly late postnatally. Disparate cell populations exhibit distinct developmental timing but also unexpected synchrony of processes underlying neural circuit construction including cell projection and adhesion. Candidate risk genes for neurodevelopmental disorders including primary microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia show disease-specific spatiotemporal enrichment within developing neocortex.

	abstract = {Objective:
To evaluate the performance of an in silico prioritization approach that was applied to 179 epileptic encephalopathy candidate genes in 2013 and to expand the application of this approach to the whole genome based on expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas.

Methods:
PubMed searches determined which of the 179 epileptic encephalopathy candidate genes had been validated. For validated genes, it was noted whether they were 1 of the 19 of 179 candidates prioritized in 2013. The in silico prioritization approach was applied genome-wide; all genes were ranked according to their coexpression strength with a reference set (i.e., 51 established epileptic encephalopathy genes) in both adult and developing human brain expression data sets. Candidate genes ranked in the top 10\% for both data sets were cross-referenced with genes previously implicated in the epileptic encephalopathies due to a de novo variant.

Results:
Five of 6 validated epileptic encephalopathy candidate genes were among the 19 prioritized in 2013 (odds ratio = 54, 95\% confidence interval [7,∞], p = 4.5 × 10−5, Fisher exact test); one gene was false negative. A total of 297 genes ranked in the top 10\% for both the adult and developing brain data sets based on coexpression with the reference set. Of these, 9 had been previously implicated in the epileptic encephalopathies (FBXO41, PLXNA1, ACOT4, PAK6, GABBR2, YWHAG, NBEA, KNDC1, and SELRC1).

Conclusions:
We conclude that brain gene coexpression data can be used to assist epileptic encephalopathy gene discovery and propose 9 genes as strong epileptic encephalopathy candidates worthy of further investigation.},

	abstract = {Microarray data have been a valuable resource for identifying transcriptional regulatory relationships among genes. As an example, brain region-specific transcriptional regulatory events have the potential of providing etiological insights into Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, there is often a paucity of suitable brain-region specific expression data obtained via microarrays or other high throughput means. The Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization (ISH) data sets (Jones et al., 2009) represent a potentially valuable alternative source of high-throughput brain region-specific gene expression data for such purposes. In this study, Allen Brain Atlas mouse ISH data in the hippocampal fields were extracted, focusing on 508 genes relevant to neurodegeneration. Transcriptional regulatory networks were learned using three high-performing network inference algorithms. Only 17\% of regulatory edges from a network reverse-engineered based on brain region-specific ISH data were also found in a network constructed upon gene expression correlations in mouse whole brain microarrays, thus showing the specificity of gene expression within brain sub-regions. Furthermore, the ISH data-based networks were used to identify instructive transcriptional regulatory relationships. Ncor2, Sp3 and Usf2 form a unique three-party regulatory motif, potentially affecting memory formation pathways. Nfe2l1, Egr1 and Usf2 emerge among regulators of genes involved in AD (e.g. Dhcr24, Aplp2, Tia1, Pdrx1, Vdac1, and Syn2). Further, Nfe2l1, Egr1 and Usf2 are sensitive to dietary factors and could be among links between dietary influences and genes in the AD etiology. Thus, this approach of harnessing brain region-specific ISH data represents a rare opportunity for gleaning unique etiological insights for diseases such as AD.},

Migraine is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over a dozen genetic loci associated with migraine. Here, we integrated migraine GWAS data with high-resolution spatial gene expression data of normal adult brains from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to identify specific brain regions and molecular pathways that are possibly involved in migraine pathophysiology. To this end, we used two complementary methods. In GWAS data from 23,285 migraine cases and 95,425 controls, we first studied modules of co-expressed genes that were calculated based on human brain expression data for enrichment of genes that showed association with migraine. Enrichment of a migraine GWAS signal was found for five modules that suggest involvement in migraine pathophysiology of: (i) neurotransmission, protein catabolism and mitochondria in the cortex; (ii) transcription regulation in the cortex and cerebellum; and (iii) oligodendrocytes and mitochondria in subcortical areas. Second, we used the high-confidence genes from the migraine GWAS as a basis to construct local migraine-related co-expression gene networks. Signatures of all brain regions and pathways that were prominent in the first method also surfaced in the second method, thus providing support that these brain regions and pathways are indeed involved in migraine pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Brain-wide mRNA mappings offer a great potential for neuroscience research as they can provide information about system proteomics. In a previous work we have correlated mRNA maps with the binding patterns of radioligands targeting specific molecular systems and imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) in unrelated control groups. This approach is potentially applicable to any imaging modality as long as an efficient procedure of imaging-genomic matching is provided. In the original work we considered mRNA brain maps of the whole human genome derived from the Allen human brain database (ABA) and we performed the analysis with a specific region-based segmentation with a resolution that was limited by the PET data parcellation. There we identified the need for a platform for imaging-genomic integration that should be usable with any imaging modalities and fully exploit the high resolution mapping of ABA dataset.

Aim
In this work we present MENGA (Multimodal Environment for Neuroimaging and Genomic Analysis), a software platform that allows the investigation of the correlation patterns between neuroimaging data of any sort (both functional and structural) with mRNA gene expression profiles derived from the ABA database at high resolution.

Results
We applied MENGA to six different imaging datasets from three modalities (PET, single photon emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) targeting the dopamine and serotonin receptor systems and the myelin molecular structure. We further investigated imaging-genomic correlations in the case of mismatch between selected proteins and imaging targets.},

Yet none allow direct comparison without reprocessing the same slices. Alternative methods using publicly available reference maps like the Allen Brain Atlas lack flexibility with respect to age and species. We propose a new approach to reconstruct a segmented region of interest from serial slices by projecting the optical density values representing a given molecular signal to a plane of view of choice, and to generalize the results into a reference map, which is built from the individual maps of all animals under study. Furthermore, to allow quantitative comparison between experimental conditions, a non-parametric pseudo t-test has been implemented. This new mapping tool was applied, optimized and validated making use of an in situ hybridization dataset that represents the spatiotemporal expression changes for the neuronal activity reporter gene zif268, in relation to cortical plasticity induced by monocular enucleation, covering the entire mouse visual cortex. The created top view maps of the mouse brain allow precisely delineating and interpreting 11 extrastriate areas surrounding mouse V1. As such, and because of the opportunity to create a planar projection of choice, these molecular maps can in the future easily be compared with functional or physiological imaging maps created with other techniques such as Ca2+, flavoprotein and optical imaging.},

	abstract = {Background: Galectins, a family of non-classically secreted, β-galactoside binding proteins is involved in several brain disorders; however, no systematic knowledge on the normal neuroanatomical distribution and functions of galectins exits. Hence, the major purpose of this study was to understand spatial distribution and predict functions of galectins in brain and also compare the degree of conservation vs. divergence between mouse and human species. The latter objective was required to determine the relevance and appropriateness of studying galectins in mouse brain which may ultimately enable us to extrapolate the findings to human brain physiology and pathologies., Results: In order to fill this crucial gap in our understanding of brain galectins, we analyzed the in situ hybridization and microarray data of adult mouse and human brain respectively, from the Allen Brain Atlas, to resolve each galectin-subtype’s spatial distribution across brain distinct cytoarchitecture. Next, transcription factors (TFs) that may regulate galectins were identified using TRANSFAC software and the list obtained was further curated to sort TFs on their confirmed transcript expression in the adult brain. Galectin-TF cluster analysis, gene-ontology annotations and co-expression networks were then extrapolated to predict distinct functional relevance of each galectin in the neuronal processes. Data shows that galectins have highly heterogeneous expression within and across brain sub-structures and are predicted to be the crucial targets of brain enriched TFs. Lgals9 had maximal spatial distribution across mouse brain with inferred predominant roles in neurogenesis while LGALS1 was ubiquitously expressed in human. Limbic region associated with learning, memory and emotions and substantia nigra associated with motor movements showed strikingly high expression of LGALS1 and LGALS8 in human vs. mouse brain. The overall expression profile of galectin-8 was most preserved across both these species, however, galectin-9 showed maximal preservation only in the cerebral cortex., Conclusion: It is for the first time that a comprehensive description of galectins’ mRNA expression profile in brain is presented. Results suggests that spatial transcriptome changes in galectins may contribute to differential brain functions and evolution across species that highlights galectins as novel signatures of brain heterogeneity and functions, which if disturbed, can promote several brain disorders.},

	abstract = {The Allen Brain Atlas-Driven Visualizations (ABADV) is a publicly accessible web-based tool created to retrieve and visualize expression energy data from the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) across multiple genes and brain structures. Though the ABA offers their own search engine and software for researchers to view their growing collection of online public data sets, including extensive gene expression and neuroanatomical data from human and mouse brain, many of their tools limit the amount of genes and brain structures researchers can view at once. To complement their work, ABADV generates multiple pie charts, bar charts and heat maps of expression energy values for any given set of genes and brain structures. Such a suite of free and easy-to-understand visualizations allows for easy comparison of gene expression across multiple brain areas. In addition, each visualization links back to the ABA so researchers may view a summary of the experimental detail. ABADV is currently supported on modern web browsers and is compatible with expression energy data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas in situ hybridization data. By creating this web application, researchers can immediately obtain and survey numerous amounts of expression energy data from the ABA, which they can then use to supplement their work or perform meta-analysis. In the future, we hope to enable ABADV across multiple data resources.},

There is, however, evidence for extra-SCN circadian oscillators. Neural tissues cultured from rats carrying the Per-luciferase transgene were used to monitor the intrinsic Per1 expression patterns in different brain areas and their response to changes in the light cycle. Although many Per-expressing brain areas were arrhythmic in culture, 14 of the 27 areas examined were rhythmic. The pineal and pituitary glands both expressed rhythms that persisted for {\textgreater}3 d in vitro, with peak expression during the subjective night. Nuclei in the olfactory bulb and the ventral hypothalamus expressed rhythmicity with peak expression at night, whereas other brain areas were either weakly rhythmic and peaked at night, or arrhythmic. After a 6 hr advance or delay in the light cycle, the pineal, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and arcuate nucleus each adjusted the phase of their rhythmicity with different kinetics. Together, these results indicate that the brain contains multiple, damped circadian oscillators outside the SCN. The phasing of these oscillators to one another may play a critical role in coordinating brain activity and its adjustment to changes in the light cycle.},

	abstract = {Author Summary As high-throughput technologies for molecular abundance profiling are becoming more inexpensive and accessible, computational inference of gene interaction networks from such data based on well-founded statistical principles is imperative to advance the understanding of regulatory mechanisms in various biological systems. Reverse engineering of gene networks has traditionally relied on analysis of whole-genome microarray data; here we present a new method, GINI, to infer gene networks from ISH images, thereby enabling exploration of spatial characteristics of gene expressions for network inference. Our method generates a Markov network, which encapsulates globally meaningful statistical-dependencies from vector-valued gene spatial patterns. In other words, we advance the state-of-art in both the usage of richer forms of expression data, and the employment of principled statistical methodology for sound network inference on such new form of data. Our results show that analyzing the spatial distribution of gene expression enables us to capture information not available from microarray data. Such an analysis is especially important in analyzing genes involved in embryonic development of Drosophila to reveal specific spatial patterning that determines the development of the 14 segments of the adult fly.},

	abstract = {Large-scale “omics” data, such as microarrays, can be used to infer underlying cellular regulatory networks in organisms, enabling us to better understand the molecular basis of disease and important traits. Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the DiffCorr package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. DiffCorr calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based “eigen-molecules” in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. DiffCorr can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. DiffCorr is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates.

At present, methods such as linkage analysis can identify the chromosomal region in which unknown disease genes are located, but the regions could contain up to hundreds of candidate genes. In this work, we present a method for prioritization of candidate genes by use of a global network distance measure, random walk analysis, for definition of similarities in protein-protein interaction networks. We tested our method on 110 disease-gene families with a total of 783 genes and achieved an area under the ROC curve of up to 98\% on simulated linkage intervals of 100 genes surrounding the disease gene, significantly outperforming previous methods based on local distance measures. Our results not only provide an improved tool for positional-cloning projects but also add weight to the assumption that phenotypically similar diseases are associated with disturbances of subnetworks within the larger protein interactome that extend beyond the disease proteins themselves.},

	abstract = {In this early part of the post-genomic era, the inference of the functions associated with gene products is a necessary first step in understanding the development and maintenance of living cells. We describe the development of a machine learning method for predicting biological process as defined by the gene ontology (GO). The algorithm uses features that can be generated from amino acid sequence alone, and does not require further experimental studies such as microarrays, 2-hybrid screens or systematic 'pull-down' assays. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used because of its comprehensive set of functional annotations, but the approach is sufficiently general for application to other eukaryote genomes. The input data include phylogenetic profiles, which represent the distribution of orthologous proteins in the genomes of other organisms, position-specific scoring matrices, and secondary structure and dynamic disorder predictions.

	abstract = {Background
Gene function annotations, which are associations between a gene and a term of a controlled vocabulary describing gene functional features, are of paramount importance in modern biology. Datasets of these annotations, such as the ones provided by the Gene Ontology Consortium, are used to design novel biological experiments and interpret their results. Despite their importance, these sources of information have some known issues. They are incomplete, since biological knowledge is far from being definitive and it rapidly evolves, and some erroneous annotations may be present. Since the curation process of novel annotations is a costly procedure, both in economical and time terms, computational tools that can reliably predict likely annotations, and thus quicken the discovery of new gene annotations, are very useful.

Methods
We used a set of computational algorithms and weighting schemes to infer novel gene annotations from a set of known ones. We used the latent semantic analysis approach, implementing two popular algorithms (Latent Semantic Indexing and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) and propose a novel method, the Semantic IMproved Latent Semantic Analysis, which adds a clustering step on the set of considered genes. Furthermore, we propose the improvement of these algorithms by weighting the annotations in the input set.

Results
We tested our methods and their weighted variants on the Gene Ontology annotation sets of three model organism genes (Bos taurus, Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster ). The methods showed their ability in predicting novel gene annotations and the weighting procedures demonstrated to lead to a valuable improvement, although the obtained results vary according to the dimension of the input annotation set and the considered algorithm.

Conclusions
Out of the three considered methods, the Semantic IMproved Latent Semantic Analysis is the one that provides better results. In particular, when coupled with a proper weighting policy, it is able to predict a significant number of novel annotations, demonstrating to actually be a helpful tool in supporting scientists in the curation process of gene functional annotations.},

	abstract = {Determining the cause of psychiatric disorders is a goal of modern neuroscience, and will hopefully lead to the discovery of treatments to either prevent or alleviate the suffering caused by these diseases. One roadblock to attaining this goal is the realization that neuropsychiatric diseases are rarely due to a single gene polymorphism, environmental exposure, or developmental insult. Rather, it is a complex interaction between these various influences that likely leads to the development of clinically relevant syndromes. Our lab is exploring the links between environmental exposures and neurobehavioral function by investigating how disruption of the circadian (daily) clock alters the structure and function of neural circuits, with the hypothesis that disrupting this crucial homeostatic system can directly contribute to altered vulnerability of the organism to other factors that interact to produce psychiatric illness. This review explores some historical and more recent findings that link disrupted circadian clocks to neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, mania, and schizophrenia. We take a comparative approach by exploring the effects observed in human populations, as well as some experimental models used in the laboratory to unravel mechanistic and causal relationships between disruption of the circadian clock and behavioral abnormalities. This is a rich area of research that we predict will contribute greatly to our understanding of how genes, environment, and development interact to modulate an individual’s vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Time-lapse imaging of human preimplantation IVF embryos has enabled objective algorithms based on novel observations of development (morphokinetics) to be used for clinical selection of embryos. Embryo aneuploidy, a major cause of IVF failure, has been correlated with specific morphokinetic variables used previously to develop an aneuploidy risk classification model. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and potential impact of this model for unselected IVF patients without biopsy and preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). Embryo outcomes – no implantation, fetal heart beat (FHB) and live birth (LB) – of 88 transferred blastocysts were compared according to calculated aneuploidy risk classes (low, medium, high). A significant difference was seen for FHB (P \&lt; 0.0001) and LB (P \&lt; 0.01) rates between embryos classified as low and medium risk. Within the low-risk class, relative increases of 74\% and 56\%, compared with rates for all blastocysts, were observed for FHB and LB respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.75 for FHB and 0.74 for LB. This study demonstrates the clinical relevance of the aneuploidy risk classification model and introduces a novel, non-invasive method of embryo selection to yield higher implantation and live birth rates without PGS.

The largest single cause of failure of the human embryo to implant, and of early miscarriage, is aneuploidy (errors in numbers of chromosomes of the early (preimplantation) human embryo). More than half of human embryos are believed to be affected by aneuploidy and many must be unwittingly transferred following IVF, resulting in failed implantation, miscarriage or the birth of a baby with a related disorder. It is not possible for embryologists in IVF laboratories to identify aneuploid embryos under the microscope; however, our studies with time-lapse incubation in conjunction with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) of IVF embryos have allowed us to develop and publish a model that rates each embryo based on its developmental patterns (morphokinetics) as being at low, medium or high risk of aneuploidy. PGS, whilst very effective, requires expensive technology and expertise, is not widely available and requires the embryo to undergo biopsy (removal of cell(s)). In this study, we tested the aneuploidy risk classification model on embryos with a known outcome and, importantly, on those embryos resulting in a live birth. This demonstrated how the model has the potential to greatly enhance IVF outcome without biopsy and PGS. By using such unique, non-invasive and specifically designed embryo selection models, we can now make more informed choices in order to select the most viable embryo to transfer, with the lowest risk of aneuploidy. Selection of an embryo classified as low risk has improved the relative chance of a live birth by 56\% over conventional embryo selection.},

	abstract = {Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is characterized by clusters of nocturnal motor seizures, which are often stereotyped and brief (5 seconds to 5 minutes). They vary from simple arousals from sleep to dramatic, often bizarre, hyperkinetic events with tonic or dystonic features. Affected individuals may experience aura. Retained awareness during seizures is common. A minority of individuals experience daytime seizures. Onset ranges from infancy to adulthood. About 80\% of individuals develop ADNFLE in the first two decades of life; mean age of onset is ten years. Clinical neurologic examination is normal and intellect is usually preserved, but reduced intellect, psychiatric comorbidity, or cognitive deficits may occur. Within a family, the manifestations of the disorder may vary considerably. ADNFLE is lifelong but not progressive. As an individual reaches middle age, attacks may become milder and less frequent., The diagnosis of ADNFLE is made on clinical grounds. A detailed history from the affected individual and witnesses, supplemented if necessary by video-EEG monitoring, is the key to diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing reveals pathogenic variants in CHRNA4, CHRNB2,CHRNA2, KCNT1, DEPDC5, or CRH in approximately 20\% of individuals with a positive family history and fewer than 5\% of individuals with a negative family history., Treatment of manifestations: Carbamazepine is associated with remission in about 70\% of individuals, often in relatively low doses. Individuals with ADNFLE associated with the CHRNA4 pathogenic variant p.Ser284Leu are more responsive to zonisamide than carbamazepine. Resistance to AEDs, present in about 30\% of affected individuals, requires a trial of all appropriate AEDs. Vagal nerve stimulation may be considered for individuals resistant to AEDs. Surveillance: Reevaluation of EEGs at regular intervals to monitor disease progression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: A medical history from relatives at risk can identify those with ADNFLE so that treatment can be initiated promptly., ADNFLE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with ADNFLE have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown, as the frequency of subtle signs of the disorder in parents has not been thoroughly evaluated and molecular genetic data are insufficient. Penetrance is estimated at 70\% and the risk to each offspring of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50\%; thus, the chance that the offspring will manifest ADNFLE is (50\% x 70\% =) 35\%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible.},

In 2005, we detected two nucleotide variations in the promoter of the CRH gene coding for the corticotropin releasing hormone in 7 patients. These variations cosegregated with the disease and were demonstrated to alter the cellular levels of this hormone. Here, we report the identification in an Italian affected family of a novel missense mutation (hpreproCRH p.Pro30Arg) located in the region of the CRH coding for the protein pro-sequence. The mutation was detected in heterozygosity in the two affected individuals. In vitro assays demonstrated that this mutation results in reduced levels of protein secretion in the short time thus suggesting that mutated people could present an altered capability to respond immediately to stress agents.},

Hundreds of diverse genes have been implicated in ASD; yet understanding how many genes, each with disparate function, can all be linked to a single clinical phenotype remains unclear. We hypothesized that understanding functional relationships between autism candidate genes during normal human brain development may provide convergent mechanistic insight into the genetic heterogeneity of ASD. We analyzed the co-expression relationships of 455 genes previously implicated in autism using the BrainSpan human transcriptome database, across 16 anatomical brain regions spanning prenatal life through adulthood. We discovered modules of ASD candidate genes with biologically relevant temporal co-expression dynamics, which were enriched for functional ontologies related to synaptogenesis, apoptosis, and GABA-ergic neurons. Furthermore, we also constructed co-expression networks from the entire transcriptome and found that ASD candidate genes were enriched in modules related to mitochondrial function, protein translation, and ubiquitination. Hub genes central to these ASD-enriched modules were further identified, and their functions supported these ontological findings. Overall, our multi-dimensional co-expression analysis of ASD candidate genes in the normal developing human brain suggests the heterogeneous set of ASD candidates share transcriptional networks related to synapse formation and elimination, protein turnover, and mitochondrial function.},

	abstract = {Studies of the brain’s transcriptome have become prominent in recent years, resulting in an accumulation of datasets with somewhat distinct attributes. These datasets, which are often analyzed only in isolation, also are often collected with divergent goals, which are reflected in their sampling properties. While many researchers have been interested in sampling gene expression in one or a few brain areas in a large number of subjects, recent efforts from the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences and others have focused instead on dense neuroanatomical sampling, necessarily limiting the number of individual donor brains studied. The purpose of the present work is to develop methods that draw on the complementary strengths of these two types of datasets for study of the human brain, and to characterize the anatomical specificity of gene expression profiles and gene co-expression networks derived from human brains using different specific technologies. The approach is applied using two publicly accessible datasets: (1) the high anatomical resolution Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA, Hawrylycz et al., 2012) and (2) a relatively large sample size, but comparatively coarse neuroanatomical dataset described previously by Gibbs et al. (2010). We found a relatively high degree of correspondence in differentially expressed genes and regional gene expression profiles across the two datasets. Gene co-expression networks defined in individual brain regions were less congruent, but also showed modest anatomical specificity. Using gene modules derived from the Gibbs dataset and from curated gene lists, we demonstrated varying degrees of anatomical specificity based on two classes of methods, one focused on network modularity and the other focused on enrichment of expression levels. Two approaches to assessing the statistical significance of a gene set’s modularity in a given brain region were studied, which provide complementary information about the anatomical specificity of a gene network of interest. Overall, the present work demonstrates the feasibility of cross-dataset analysis of human brain microarray studies, and offers a new approach to annotating gene lists in a neuroanatomical context.},

	abstract = {Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encode an animal’s position and orientation in space. Within the MEC spatial representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell adhesion- and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuroanatomical data. Our results support the hypothesis that differences in gene expression contribute to functional specialization of superficial layers of the MEC and dorsoventral organization of the scale of spatial representations., Higher brain functions such as spatial cognition are carried out in specialized brain areas. Within a specialized brain area nerve cells with different functions are organized in layers and gradients. It is possible that this topographical organization reflects underlying differences in molecular organization of the brain. However, systematic comparison of the expression patterns of tens of thousands of genes at the resolution of layers and borders is challenging. Here we develop a new computational pipeline that addresses this problem. We apply this pipeline to analysis of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), a brain structure that is important for spatial cognition. Our analysis shows that the MEC is highly organized at a molecular level, identifies related groups of genes that might underlie functional specialization, and implicates energy-related genes in vulnerability of certain neuronal populations to neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Our computational pipeline may have general utility for high-throughput and high-resolution analysis of brain anatomy. Our results support the notion that molecular differences contribute to functional specialization of higher cognitive circuits.},

 Allen Brain Atlas, we systematically and quantitatively analyzed the spatial
 and cellular distribution of 307 Slc genes, which represent nearly
 90\% of presently known mouse Slc genes, in the adult C57BL/6J mouse
 brain. Our analysis showed that 252 (82\%) of the 307 Slc genes are
 present in the brain, and a large proportion of these genes were detected at
 low to moderate expression levels. Evaluation of 20 anatomical brain
 subdivisions demonstrated a comparable level of Slc gene complexity
 but significant difference in transcript enrichment. The distribution of the
 expressed Slc genes was diverse, ranging from near-ubiquitous to
 highly localized. Functional annotation in 20 brain regions, including the
 blood-brain and blood-cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) barriers, suggests major
 roles of Slc transporters in supporting brain energy utilization,
 neurotransmission, nutrient supply, and CSF production. Furthermore,
 hierarchical cluster analysis revealed intricate Slc expression
 patterns associated with neuroanatomical organization. Our studies also

	abstract = {Rodent self-grooming is an important, evolutionarily conserved behavior, highly sensitive to pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Mice with aberrant grooming phenotypes are currently used to model various human disorders. Therefore, it is critical to understand the biology of grooming behavior, and to assess its translational validity to humans. The present in-silico study used publicly available gene expression and behavioral data obtained from several inbred mouse strains in the open-field, light–dark box, elevated plus- and elevated zero-maze tests. As grooming duration differed between strains, our analysis revealed several candidate genes with significant correlations between gene expression in the brain and grooming duration. The Allen Brain Atlas, STRING, GoMiner and Mouse Genome Informatics databases were used to functionally map and analyze these candidate mouse genes against their human orthologs, assessing the strain ranking of their expression and the regional distribution of expression in the mouse brain. This allowed us to identify an interconnected network of candidate genes (which have expression levels that correlate with grooming behavior), display altered patterns of expression in key brain areas related to grooming, and underlie important functions in the brain. Collectively, our results demonstrate the utility of large-scale, high-throughput data-mining and in-silico modeling for linking genomic and behavioral data, as well as their potential to identify novel neural targets for complex neurobehavioral phenotypes, including grooming.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0017258},
	abstract = {Many previous studies have shown that by using variants of "guilt-by-association", gene function predictions can be made with very high statistical confidence. In these studies, it is assumed that the "associations" in the data (e.g., protein interaction partners) of a gene are necessary in establishing "guilt". In this paper we show that multifunctionality, rather than association, is a primary driver of gene function prediction. We first show that knowledge of the degree of multifunctionality alone can produce astonishingly strong performance when used as a predictor of gene function. We then demonstrate how multifunctionality is encoded in gene interaction data (such as protein interactions and coexpression networks) and how this can feed forward into gene function prediction algorithms. We find that high-quality gene function predictions can be made using data that possesses no information on which gene interacts with which. By examining a wide range of networks from mouse, human and yeast, as well as multiple prediction methods and evaluation metrics, we provide evidence that this problem is pervasive and does not reflect the failings of any particular algorithm or data type. We propose computational controls that can be used to provide more meaningful control when estimating gene function prediction performance. We suggest that this source of bias due to multifunctionality is important to control for, with widespread implications for the interpretation of genomics studies.},

But are these reconstructed networks a reliable source of biological interactions? Do some network inference methods offer dramatically improved performance on certain types of networks? To facilitate the use of network inference methods in systems biology, we report a large-scale simulation study comparing the ability of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers to reverse engineer Bayesian networks. The MCMC samplers we investigated included foundational and state-of-the-art Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling approaches, as well as novel samplers we have designed. To enable a comprehensive comparison, we simulated gene expression and genetics data from known network structures under a range of biologically plausible scenarios. We examine the overall quality of network inference via different methods, as well as how their performance is affected by network characteristics. Our simulations reveal that network size, edge density, and strength of gene-to-gene signaling are major parameters that differentiate the performance of various samplers. Specifically, more recent samplers including our novel methods outperform traditional samplers for highly interconnected large networks with strong gene-to-gene signaling. Our newly developed samplers show comparable or superior performance to the top existing methods. Moreover, this performance gain is strongest in networks with biologically oriented topology, which indicates that our novel samplers are suitable for inferring biological networks. The performance of MCMC samplers in this simulation framework can guide the choice of methods for network reconstruction using systems genetics data.},

	abstract = {In a research environment dominated by reductionist approaches to brain disease mechanisms, gene network analysis provides a complementary framework in which to tackle the complex dysregulations that occur in neuropsychiatric and other neurological disorders. Gene-gene expression correlations are a common source of molecular networks because they can be extracted from high-dimensional disease data and encapsulate the activity of multiple regulatory systems. However, the analysis of gene coexpression patterns is often treated as a mechanistic black box, in which looming 'hub genes' direct cellular networks, and where other features are obscured. By examining the biophysical bases of coexpression and gene regulatory changes that occur in disease, recent studies suggest it is possible to use coexpression networks as a multi-omic screening procedure to generate novel hypotheses for disease mechanisms. Because technical processing steps can affect the outcome and interpretation of coexpression networks, we examine the assumptions and alternatives to common patterns of coexpression analysis and discuss additional topics such as acceptable datasets for coexpression analysis, the robust identification of modules, disease-related prioritization of genes and molecular systems and network meta-analysis. To accelerate coexpression research beyond modules and hubs, we highlight some emerging directions for coexpression network research that are especially relevant to complex brain disease, including the centrality-lethality relationship, integration with machine learning approaches and network pharmacology.},

Studies comparing transcription in human and mouse have come to varied conclusions, in part because of their relatively small sample sizes or underpowered methodologies. To better characterize gene expression differences between mouse and human, we took a systems-biology approach by using weighted gene coexpression network analysis on more than 1,000 microarrays from brain. We find that global network properties of the brain transcriptome are highly preserved between species. Furthermore, all modules of highly coexpressed genes identified in mouse were identified in human, with those related to conserved cellular functions showing the strongest between-species preservation. Modules corresponding to glial and neuronal cells were sufficiently preserved between mouse and human to permit identification of cross species cell-class marker genes. We also identify several robust human-specific modules, including one strongly correlated with measures of Alzheimer disease progression across multiple data sets, whose hubs are poorly-characterized genes likely involved in Alzheimer disease. We present multiple lines of evidence suggesting links between neurodegenerative disease and glial cell types in human, including human-specific correlation of presenilin-1 with oligodendrocyte markers, and significant enrichment for known neurodegenerative disease genes in microglial modules. Together, this work identifies convergent and divergent pathways in mouse and human, and provides a systematic framework that will be useful for understanding the applicability of mouse models for human brain disorders.},

	doi = {10.1093/brain/awu132},
	abstract = {Brain networks or 'connectomes' include a minority of highly connected hub nodes that are functionally valuable, because their topological centrality supports integrative processing and adaptive behaviours. Recent studies also suggest that hubs have higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections than other brain regions, and therefore could be considered biologically costly. Assuming that hubs thus normally combine both high topological value and high biological cost, we predicted that pathological brain lesions would be concentrated in hub regions. To test this general hypothesis, we first identified the hubs of brain anatomical networks estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data on healthy volunteers (n = 56), and showed that computational attacks targeted on hubs disproportionally degraded the efficiency of brain networks compared to random attacks. We then prepared grey matter lesion maps, based on meta-analyses of published magnetic resonance imaging data on more than 20 000 subjects and 26 different brain disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions that were common across all brain disorders were more likely to be located in hubs of the normal brain connectome (P {\textless} 10(-4), permutation test). Specifically, nine brain disorders had lesions that were significantly more likely to be located in hubs (P {\textless} 0.05, permutation test), including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Both these disorders had significantly hub-concentrated lesion distributions, although (almost completely) distinct subsets of cortical hubs were lesioned in each disorder: temporal lobe hubs specifically were associated with higher lesion probability in Alzheimer's disease, whereas in schizophrenia lesions were concentrated in both frontal and temporal cortical hubs. These results linking pathological lesions to the topological centrality of nodes in the normal diffusion tensor imaging connectome were generally replicated when hubs were defined instead by the meta-analysis of more than 1500 task-related functional neuroimaging studies of healthy volunteers to create a normative functional co-activation network. We conclude that the high cost/high value hubs of human brain networks are more likely to be anatomically abnormal than non-hubs in many (if not all) brain disorders.},

The model displays multiple temporal hierarchies, as evidenced by contrasting responses to visual versus somatosensory stimulation. Moreover, slower prefrontal and temporal areas have a disproportionate impact on global brain dynamics. These findings establish a circuit mechanism for "temporal receptive windows" that are progressively enlarged along the cortical hierarchy, suggest an extension of time integration in decision making from local to large circuits, and should prompt a re-evaluation of the analysis of functional connectivity (measured by fMRI or electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) by taking into account inter-areal heterogeneity.},

In this review, we discuss how the study of molecular, cellular and brain networks provides additional information on the effect of LOAD-associated genetic variants. We then discuss emerging combinations of omic data types in multiscale models, which provide a more comprehensive representation of the effect of LOAD-associated genetic variants at multiple biophysical scales.

Therefore, developing statistical learning models for predicting phenotypic values from all available molecular information that are capable of capturing complex genetic network architectures is of great importance. Bayesian kernel ridge regression is a non-parametric prediction model proposed for this purpose. Its essence is to create a spatial distance-based relationship matrix called a kernel. Although the set of all single nucleotide polymorphism genotype configurations on which a model is built is finite, past research has mainly used a Gaussian kernel.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently associated with comorbid aggression and sleep disturbances. The sleep/wake cycle is under the control of the circadian system which is moderated by clock genes. Clock genes can regulate the transcription of monoamine oxidase A, which is involved in the degradation of monoamines. Disturbances in monoamine interaction with clock genes in those with monoamine gene polymorphisms may regulate susceptibility of ADHD and comorbid aggression/sleep disturbances. While monoamines influence circadian rhythm and clock gene expression, circadian rhythm components modulate aggressive behavior, and altered clock genes expression have been associated with ADHD. We propose a mechanism by which circadian rhythm and clock gene expression may influence ADHD and comorbid aggression through the modulation of neurotransmitters. The role of clock genes in ADHD patients with comorbid aggression awaits further research; therefore we also indicate directions for future studies to help increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms in ADHD with comorbid aggression and sleep disturbances.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-015-0553-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Profiling gene expression in brain structures at various spatial and temporal scales is essential to understanding how genes regulate the development of brain structures. The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas provides high-resolution 3-D in situ hybridization (ISH) gene expression patterns in multiple developing stages of the mouse brain. Currently, the ISH images are annotated with anatomical terms manually. In this paper, we propose a computational approach to annotate gene expression pattern images in the mouse brain at various structural levels over the course of development.
RESULTS: We applied deep convolutional neural network that was trained on a large set of natural images to extract features from the ISH images of developing mouse brain. As a baseline representation, we applied invariant image feature descriptors to capture local statistics from ISH images and used the bag-of-words approach to build image-level representations. Both types of features from multiple ISH image sections of the entire brain were then combined to build 3-D, brain-wide gene expression representations. We employed regularized learning methods for discriminating gene expression patterns in different brain structures. Results show that our approach of using convolutional model as feature extractors achieved superior performance in annotating gene expression patterns at multiple levels of brain structures throughout four developing ages. Overall, we achieved average AUC of 0.894 ± 0.014, as compared with 0.820 ± 0.046 yielded by the bag-of-words approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep convolutional neural network model trained on natural image sets and applied to gene expression pattern annotation tasks yielded superior performance, demonstrating its transfer learning property is applicable to such biological image sets.},

	abstract = {Microarray data have been a valuable resource for identifying transcriptional regulatory relationships among genes. As an example, brain region-specific transcriptional regulatory events have the potential of providing etiological insights into Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, there is often a paucity of suitable brain-region specific expression data obtained via microarrays or other high throughput means. The Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization (ISH) data sets (Jones et al., 2009) represent a potentially valuable alternative source of high-throughput brain region-specific gene expression data for such purposes. In this study, Allen Brain Atlas mouse ISH data in the hippocampal fields were extracted, focusing on 508 genes relevant to neurodegeneration. Transcriptional regulatory networks were learned using three high-performing network inference algorithms. Only 17\% of regulatory edges from a network reverse-engineered based on brain region-specific ISH data were also found in a network constructed upon gene expression correlations in mouse whole brain microarrays, thus showing the specificity of gene expression within brain sub-regions. Furthermore, the ISH data-based networks were used to identify instructive transcriptional regulatory relationships. Ncor2, Sp3 and Usf2 form a unique three-party regulatory motif, potentially affecting memory formation pathways. Nfe2l1, Egr1 and Usf2 emerge among regulators of genes involved in AD (e.g. Dhcr24, Aplp2, Tia1, Pdrx1, Vdac1, and Syn2). Further, Nfe2l1, Egr1 and Usf2 are sensitive to dietary factors and could be among links between dietary influences and genes in the AD etiology. Thus, this approach of harnessing brain region-specific ISH data represents a rare opportunity for gleaning unique etiological insights for diseases such as AD.},

	abstract = {Network theory provides a principled abstraction of the human brain: reducing a complex system into a simpler representation from which to investigate brain organisation. Recent advancement in the neuroimaging field is towards representing brain connectivity as a dynamic process in order to gain a deeper understanding of how the brain is organised for information transport. In this paper we propose a network modelling approach based on the heat kernel to capture the process of heat diffusion in complex networks. By applying the heat kernel to structural brain networks, we define new features which quantify change in heat propagation. Identifying suitable features which can classify networks between cohorts is useful towards understanding the effect of disease on brain architecture. We demonstrate the discriminative power of heat kernel features in both synthetic and clinical preterm data. By generating an extensive range of synthetic networks with varying density and randomisation, we investigate heat diffusion in relation to changes in network topology. We demonstrate that our proposed features provide a metric of network efficiency and may be indicative of organisational principles commonly associated with, for example, small-world architecture. In addition, we show the potential of these features to characterise and classify between network topologies. We further demonstrate our methodology in a clinical setting by applying it to a large cohort of preterm babies scanned at term equivalent age from which diffusion networks were computed. We show that our heat kernel features are able to successfully predict motor function measured at two years of age (sensitivity, specificity, F-score, accuracy = 75.0, 82.5, 78.6, and 82.3\%, respectively).},

Until recently, however, comprehensive cataloging of gene expression across the central nervous system has been lacking. The Allen Institute for Brain Science, as part of its mission to propel neuroscience research, has completed several large gene-mapping projects in mouse, nonhuman primate, and human brain, producing informative online public resources and tools. Here we present the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, covering {\textasciitilde}20,000 genes throughout the adult mouse brain; the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas, detailing expression of approximately 2,000 important developmental genes across seven embryonic and postnatal stages of brain growth; and the Allen Spinal Cord Atlas, revealing expression for {\textasciitilde}20,000 genes in the adult and neonatal mouse spinal cords. Integrated data-mining tools, including reference atlases, informatics analyses, and 3-D viewers, are described. For these massive-scale projects, high-throughput industrial techniques were developed to standardize and reliably repeat experimental goals. To verify consistency and accuracy, a detailed analysis of the 1,000 most viewed genes for the adult mouse brain (according to website page views) was performed by comparing our data with peer-reviewed literature and other databases. We show that our data are highly consistent with independent sources and provide a comprehensive compendium of information and tools used by thousands of researchers each month.

The Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) project systematically profiles three-dimensional high-resolution gene expression in postnatal mouse brains for thousands of genes. By unveiling gene behaviors at both the cellular and molecular levels, ABA is becoming a unique and comprehensive neuroscience data source for decoding enigmatic biological processes in the brain. Given the unprecedented volume and complexity of the in situ hybridization image data, data mining in this area is extremely challenging. Currently, the ABA database mainly serves as an online reference for visual inspection of individual genes; the underlying rich information of this large data set is yet to be explored by novel computational tools. In this proof-of-concept study, we studied the hypothesis that genes sharing similar three-dimensional expression profiles in the mouse brain are likely to share similar biological functions.

Results
In order to address the pattern comparison challenge when analyzing the ABA database, we developed a robust image filtering method, dubbed histogram-row-column (HRC) algorithm. We demonstrated how the HRC algorithm offers the sensitivity of identifying a manageable number of gene pairs based on automatic pattern searching from an original large brain image collection. This tool enables us to quickly identify genes of similar in situ hybridization patterns in a semi-automatic fashion and consequently allows us to discover several gene expression patterns with expression neighborhoods containing genes of similar functional categories.

Conclusion
Given a query brain image, HRC is a fully automated algorithm that is able to quickly mine vast number of brain images and identify a manageable subset of genes that potentially shares similar spatial co-distribution patterns for further visual inspection. A three-dimensional in situ hybridization pattern, if statistically significant, could serve as a fingerprint of certain gene function. Databases such as ABA provide valuable data source for characterizing brain-related gene functions when armed with powerful image querying tools like HRC.},

	abstract = {Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) provides a valuable resource of spatial/temporal gene expressions in mammalian brains. Despite rich information extracted from this database, current analyses suffer from several limitations. First, most studies are either gene-centric or region-centric, thus are inadequate to capture the superposition of multiple spatial-temporal patterns. Second, standard tools of expression analysis such as matrix factorization can capture those patterns but do not explicitly incorporate spatial dependency. To overcome those limitations, we proposed a computational method to detect recurrent patterns in the spatial-temporal gene expression data of developing mouse brains. We demonstrated that regional distinction in brain development could be revealed by localized gene expression patterns. The patterns expressed in the forebrain, medullary and pontomedullary, and basal ganglia are enriched with genes involved in forebrain development, locomotory behavior, and dopamine metabolism respectively. In addition, the timing of global gene expression patterns reflects the general trends of molecular events in mouse brain development. Furthermore, we validated functional implications of the inferred patterns by showing genes sharing similar spatial-temporal expression patterns with Lhx2 exhibited differential expression in the embryonic forebrains of Lhx2 mutant mice. These analysis outcomes confirm the utility of recurrent expression patterns in studying brain development.},

	abstract = {Objective
Proteins are vital biological molecules driving many fundamental cellular processes. They rarely act alone, but form interacting groups called protein complexes. The study of protein complexes is a key goal in systems biology. Recently, large protein–protein interaction (PPI) datasets have been published and a plethora of computational methods that provide new ideas for the prediction of protein complexes have been implemented. However, most of the methods suffer from two major limitations: First, they do not account for proteins participating in multiple functions and second, they are unable to handle weighted PPI graphs. Moreover, the problem remains open as existing algorithms and tools are insufficient in terms of predictive metrics.
Method
In the present paper, we propose gradually expanding neighborhoods with adjustment (GENA), a new algorithm that gradually expands neighborhoods in a graph starting from highly informative “seed” nodes. GENA considers proteins as multifunctional molecules allowing them to participate in more than one protein complex. In addition, GENA accepts weighted PPI graphs by using a weighted evaluation function for each cluster.
Results
In experiments with datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human, GENA outperformed Markov clustering, restricted neighborhood search and clustering with overlapping neighborhood expansion, three state-of-the-art methods for computationally predicting protein complexes. Seven PPI networks and seven evaluation datasets were used in total. GENA outperformed existing methods in 16 out of 18 experiments achieving an average improvement of 5.5\% when the maximum matching ratio metric was used. Our method was able to discover functionally homogeneous protein clusters and uncover important network modules in a Parkinson expression dataset. When used on the human networks, around 47\% of the detected clusters were enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms with depth higher than five in the GO hierarchy.
Conclusions
In the present manuscript, we introduce a new method for the computational prediction of protein complexes by making the realistic assumption that proteins participate in multiple protein complexes and cellular functions. Our method can detect accurate and functionally homogeneous clusters.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. It is widely believed that this is secondary to colonic inflammation. However, the severity of colonic inflammation has never been shown to be a risk factor.
METHODS: We devised a case-control study of patients with long-standing extensive ulcerative colitis to examine various potential risk factors for neoplasia. All cases of colorectal neoplasia detected from our surveillance program between January 1, 1988, and January 1, 2002, were studied (n = 68). Each patient was matched with 2 control patients from the same surveillance population (n = 136). Matching was for sex, colitis extent, age at onset, duration of colitis, and year of index surveillance colonoscopy. Segmental colonoscopic and histological inflammation was recorded by using a simple score (0, normal; 1, quiescent/chronic inflammation; and 2, 3, and 4, mild, moderate, and severe active inflammation, respectively). Other data collected included history of primary sclerosing cholangitis, family history of colorectal cancer, and smoking and drug history (mesalamine 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine, and folate).
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the colonoscopic (odds ratio, 2.5; P = 0.001) and histological (odds ratio, 5.1; P {\textless} 0.001) inflammation scores and the risk of colorectal neoplasia. No other factors reached statistical significance. On multivariate analysis, only the histological inflammation score remained significant (odds ratio, 4.7; P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In long-standing extensive ulcerative colitis, the severity of colonic inflammation is an important determinant of the risk of colorectal neoplasia. Endoscopic and histological grading of inflammation could allow better risk stratification for surveillance programs.},

	abstract = {The risk of colorectal cancer for any patient with ulcerative colitis is known to be elevated, and is estimated to be 2\% after 10 years, 8\% after 20 years and 18\% after 30 years of disease. Risk factors for cancer include extent and duration of ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, a family history of sporadic colorectal cancer, severity of histologic bowel inflammation, and in some studies, young age at onset of colitis. In this review, the authors discuss recent epidemiological trends and causes for the observed changes. Population-based studies published within the past 5 years suggest that this risk has decreased over time, despite the low frequency of colectomies. The crude annual incidence rate of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis ranges from approximately 0.06\% to 0.16\% with a relative risk of 1.0-2.75. The exact mechanism for this change is unknown; it may partly be explained by the more widespread use of maintenance therapy and surveillance colonoscopy.},

The net reclassification improvement (NRI) has gained popularity in this role because of its simplicity, ease of estimation, and understandability. Although the NRI provides a single-number summary describing the improvement new markers bring to a model, it also has several potential disadvantages. Any improved classification by the new model is weighted equally, regardless of the direction of reclassification. In prediction models that already identify the high- and low-risk groups well, a positive NRI may not mean better classification of those with medium risk, where it could make the most difference. Also, overfitting, or otherwise misspecified training models, produce overly positive NRI results. Because of the unaccounted for uncertainty in the model coefficient estimation, investigators should rely on bootstrapped confidence intervals rather than on tests of significance. Keeping in mind the limitations and drawbacks, the NRI can be helpful when used correctly.},

	abstract = {Net reclassification indices have recently become popular statistics for measuring the prediction increment of new biomarkers. We review the various types of net reclassification indices and their correct interpretations. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of quantifying the prediction increment with these indices. For pre-defined risk categories, we relate net reclassification indices to existing measures of the prediction increment. We also consider statistical methodology for constructing confidence intervals for net reclassification indices and evaluate the merits of hypothesis testing based on such indices. We recommend that investigators using net reclassification indices should report them separately for events (cases) and nonevents (controls). When there are two risk categories, the components of net reclassification indices are the same as the changes in the true-positive and false-positive rates. We advocate use of true- and false-positive rates and suggest it is more useful for investigators to retain the existing, descriptive terms. When there are three or more risk categories, we recommend against net reclassification indices because they do not adequately account for clinically important differences in shifts among risk categories. The category-free net reclassification index is a new descriptive device designed to avoid pre-defined risk categories. However, it suffers from many of the same problems as other measures such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In addition, the category-free index can mislead investigators by overstating the incremental value of a biomarker, even in independent validation data. When investigators want to test a null hypothesis of no prediction increment, the well-established tests for coefficients in the regression model are superior to the net reclassification index. If investigators want to use net reclassification indices, confidence intervals should be calculated using bootstrap methods rather than published variance formulas. The preferred single-number summary of the prediction increment is the improvement in net benefit.},

Current research suggests that deep convolutional neural networks are suited to automate feature extraction from raw sensor inputs. However, human activities are made of complex sequences of motor movements, and capturing this temporal dynamics is fundamental for successful HAR. Based on the recent success of recurrent neural networks for time series domains, we propose a generic deep framework for activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units, which: (i) is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors; (ii) can perform sensor fusion naturally; (iii) does not require expert knowledge in designing features; and (iv) explicitly models the temporal dynamics of feature activations. We evaluate our framework on two datasets, one of which has been used in a public activity recognition challenge. Our results show that our framework outperforms competing deep non-recurrent networks on the challenge dataset by 4\% on average; outperforming some of the previous reported results by up to 9\%. Our results show that the framework can be applied to homogeneous sensor modalities, but can also fuse multimodal sensors to improve performance. We characterise key architectural hyperparameters’ influence on performance to provide insights about their optimisation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Time-lapse observation presents an opportunity for optimizing embryo selection based on morphological grading as well as providing novel kinetic parameters, which may further improve accurate selection of viable embryos. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify the morphokinetic parameters specific to embryos that were capable of implanting. In order to compare a large number of embryos, with minimal variation in culture conditions, we have used an automatic embryo monitoring system.
METHODS Using a tri-gas IVF incubator with a built-in camera designed to automatically acquire images at defined time points, we have simultaneously monitored up to 72 individual embryos without removing the embryos from the controlled environment. Images were acquired every 15 min in five different focal planes for at least 64 h for each embryo. We have monitored the development of transferred embryos from 285 couples undergoing their first ICSI cycle. The total number of transferred embryos was 522, of which 247 either failed to implant or fully implanted, with full implantation meaning that all transferred embryos in a treatment implanted.
RESULTS A detailed retrospective analysis of cleavage times, blastomere size and multinucleation was made for the 247 transferred embryos with either failed or full implantation. We found that several parameters were significantly correlated with subsequent implantation (e.g. time of first and subsequent cleavages as well as the time between cleavages). The most predictive parameters were: (i) time of division to 5 cells, t5 (48.8–56.6 h after ICSI); (ii) time between division to 3 cells and subsequent division to 4 cells, s2 (≤0.76 h) and (iii) duration of cell cycle two, i.e. time between division to 2 cells and division to 3 cells, cc2 (≤11.9 h). We also observed aberrant behavior such as multinucleation at the 4 cell stage, uneven blastomere size at the 2 cell stage and abrupt cell division to three or more cells, which appeared to largely preclude implantation.
CONCLUSIONS The image acquisition and time-lapse analysis system makes it possible to determine exact timing of embryo cleavages in a clinical setting. We propose a multivariable model based on our findings to classify embryos according to their probability of implantation. The efficacy of this classification will be evaluated in a prospective randomized study that ultimately will determine if implantation rates can be improved by time-lapse analysis.},

The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Motivation: It has long been hypothesized that incorporating models of network noise as well as edge directions and known pathway information into the representation of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks might improve their utility for functional inference. However, a simple way to do this has not been obvious. We find that diffusion state distance (DSD), our recent diffusion-based metric for measuring dissimilarity in PPI networks, has natural extensions that incorporate confidence, directions and can even express coherent pathways by calculating DSD on an augmented graph.
Results: We define three incremental versions of DSD which we term cDSD, caDSD and capDSD, where the capDSD matrix incorporates confidence, known directed edges, and pathways into the measure of how similar each pair of nodes is according to the structure of the PPI network. We test four popular function prediction methods (majority vote, weighted majority vote, multi-way cut and functional flow) using these different matrices on the Baker’s yeast PPI network in cross-validation. The best performing method is weighted majority vote using capDSD. We then test the performance of our augmented DSD methods on an integrated heterogeneous set of protein association edges from the STRING database. The superior performance of capDSD in this context confirms that treating the pathways as probabilistic units is more powerful than simply incorporating pathway edges independently into the network.

	abstract = {Author Summary   Numerous studies have identified links between too little or too much sleep and circadian misalignment with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, cause-and-effect is not easily determined, because of multiple confounding factors affecting both sleep patterns and disease risk. Using the first release of the UK Biobank study, which combines detailed measurements and questionnaire data with genetic data, we investigate the genetics of two self-report sleep measures, chronotype and average sleep duration, in 128,266 white British individuals. We replicate previous genetic associations and identify seven and two novel genetic variants influencing chronotype and sleep duration, respectively. Associated variants are located near genes implicated in circadian rhythm regulation ( RGS16 ,  PER2 ), near a serotonin receptor gene ( HTR6 ) and another gene ( INADL ) encoding a protein thought to be important in photosensitive retinal cells, cells known to communicate with the brain’s primary circadian pacemaker. Using the genetic risk factors, we estimate the unconfounded causal associations of BMI and type 2 diabetes on sleep patterns (and vice versa) through Mendelian Randomisation. However, we find no evidence for causal associations in either direction. The full UK Biobank release of 500,000 individuals will boost our power to detect causal associations.},

	abstract = {Our sleep timing preference, or chronotype, is a manifestation of our internal biological clock. Variation in chronotype has been linked to sleep disorders, cognitive and physical performance, and chronic disease. Here we perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported chronotype within the UK Biobank cohort (n=100,420). We identify 12 new genetic loci that implicate known components of the circadian clock machinery and point to previously unstudied genetic variants and candidate genes that might modulate core circadian rhythms or light-sensing pathways. Pathway analyses highlight central nervous and ocular systems and fear-response-related processes. Genetic correlation analysis suggests chronotype shares underlying genetic pathways with schizophrenia, educational attainment and possibly BMI. Further, Mendelian randomization suggests that evening chronotype relates to higher educational attainment. These results not only expand our knowledge of the circadian system in humans but also expose the influence of circadian characteristics over human health and life-history variables such as educational attainment., 
Here, Richa Saxena and colleagues perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of self-reported morningness/eveningness preference in the UKBiobank cohort, and identify new genetic loci that contribute to a person's chronotype.},

Identification of these genes facilitates exposure of the underlying cellular infrastructure and increases understanding of various structural genomic features. In addition, housekeeping genes are instrumental for calibration in many biotechnological applications and genomic studies. Advances in our ability to measure RNA expression have resulted in a gradual increase in the number of identified housekeeping genes. Here, we describe housekeeping gene detection in the era of massive parallel sequencing and RNA-seq. We emphasize the importance of expression at a constant level and provide a list of 3804 human genes that are expressed uniformly across a panel of tissues. Several exceptionally uniform genes are singled out for future experimental use, such as RT-PCR control genes. Finally, we discuss both ways in which current technology can meet some of past obstacles encountered, and several as yet unmet challenges.},

However, while equivalences in the DNA sequence of two species may be readily inferred through evolutionary models, the identification of equivalence in the phenotypic consequences resulting from comparable genetic variation is far from straightforward, limiting the value of the modelling paradigm. In this review, we provide an overview of the emerging statistical and computational approaches to objectively identify phenotypic equivalence between human and model organisms with examples from the vertebrate models, mouse and zebrafish. Firstly, we discuss enrichment approaches, which deem the most frequent phenotype among the orthologues of a set of genes associated with a common human phenotype as the orthologous phenotype, or phenolog, in the model species. Secondly, we introduce and discuss computational reasoning approaches to identify phenotypic equivalences made possible through the development of intra- and interspecies ontologies. Finally, we consider the particular challenges involved in modelling neuropsychiatric disorders, which illustrate many of the remaining difficulties in developing comprehensive and unequivocal interspecies phenotype mappings.},

Existing ontology tools provide functional, curated annotations for many genes and can be used to develop mechanistic hypotheses; yet information about the spatial expression of genes may be equally useful in interpreting results and forming novel hypotheses for a trait. Therefore, we developed an approach for statistically testing the relationship between gene expression across the body and sets of candidate genes from across the genome. We validated this tool and tested its utility on three applications. First, we show that the expression of genes in associated loci from GWA studies implicates specific tissues for 57 out of 98 traits. Second, we tested the ability of the tool to identify novel relationships between gene expression and phenotypes. Specifically, we experimentally confirmed an underappreciated prediction highlighted by our tool: that white blood cell count--a quantitative trait of the immune system--is genetically modulated by genes expressed in the skin. Finally, using gene lists derived from exome sequencing data, we show that human genes under selective constraint are disproportionately expressed in nervous system tissues.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in neuroimaging technology and molecular genetics provide the unique opportunity to investigate genetic influence on the variation of brain attributes. Since the year 2000, when the initial publication on brain imaging and genetics was released, imaging genetics has been a rapidly growing research approach with increasing publications every year. Several reviews have been offered to the research community focusing on various study designs. In addition to study design, analytic tools and their proper implementation are also critical to the success of a study. In this review, we survey recent publications using data from neuroimaging and genetics, focusing on methods capturing multivariate effects accommodating the large number of variables from both imaging data and genetic data. We group the analyses of genetic or genomic data into either a priori driven or data driven approach, including gene-set enrichment analysis, multifactor dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and clustering. For the analyses of imaging data, ICA and extensions of ICA are the most widely used multivariate methods. Given detailed reviews of multivariate analyses of imaging data available elsewhere, we provide a brief summary here that includes a recently proposed method known as independent vector analysis. Finally, we review methods focused on bridging the imaging and genetic data by establishing multivariate and multiple genotype-phenotype-associations, including sparse partial least squares, sparse canonical correlation analysis, sparse reduced rank regression and parallel ICA. These methods are designed to extract latent variables from both genetic and imaging data, which become new genotypes and phenotypes, and the links between the new genotype-phenotype pairs are maximized using different cost functions. The relationship between these methods along with their assumptions, advantages, and limitations are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background   Phenotypic features associated with genes and diseases play an important role in disease-related studies and most of the available methods focus solely on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database without considering the controlled vocabulary. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized and controlled vocabulary covering phenotypic abnormalities in human diseases, and becomes a comprehensive resource for computational analysis of human disease phenotypes. Most of the existing HPO-based software tools cannot be used offline and provide only few similarity measures. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing a comprehensive and offline software for phenotypic features similarity based on HPO.       Results   HPOSim is an R package for analyzing phenotypic similarity for genes and diseases based on HPO data. Seven commonly used semantic similarity measures are implemented in HPOSim. Enrichment analysis of gene sets and disease sets are also implemented, including hypergeometric enrichment analysis and network ontology analysis (NOA).       Conclusions   HPOSim can be used to predict disease genes and explore disease-related function of gene modules.

	abstract = {The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a central pacemaker in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and subsidiary oscillators in nearly all body cells. The SCN clock, which is adjusted to geophysical time by the photoperiod, synchronizes peripheral clocks through a wide variety of systemic cues. The latter include signals depending on feeding cycles, glucocorticoid hormones, rhythmic blood-borne signals eliciting daily changes in actin dynamics and serum response factor (SRF) activity, and sensors of body temperature rhythms, such as heat shock transcription factors and the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein CIRP. To study these systemic signalling pathways, we designed and engineered a novel, highly photosensitive apparatus, dubbed RT-Biolumicorder. This device enables us to record circadian luciferase reporter gene expression in the liver and other organs of freely moving mice over months in real time. Owing to the multitude of systemic signalling pathway involved in the phase resetting of peripheral clocks the disruption of any particular one has only minor effects on the steady state phase of circadian gene expression in organs such as the liver. Nonetheless, the implication of specific pathways in the synchronization of clock gene expression can readily be assessed by monitoring the phase-shifting kinetics using the RT-Biolumicorder.},

The coherent timing systems could sustain robust output of circadian rhythms in response to the entrainment controlled environmentally. Disparate approaches have discovered that clock genes and clock-controlled genes (CCGs) exist in nearly all mammalian cell types and are essential for establishing the mechanisms and complexity of internal time-keeping systems. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the control of homeostasis and pathology in the liver involves intricate loops of transcriptional and post-translational regulation of clock genes expression. This review will focus on the recent advances with great importance concerning clock rhythms linking liver homeostasis and diseases. We particularly highlight what is currently known of the evolving insights into the mechanisms underlying circadian clock .

	abstract = {Background
Oncogenes are a type of genes that have the potential to cause cancer. Most normal cells undergo programmed cell death, namely apoptosis, but activated oncogenes can help cells avoid apoptosis and survive. Thus, studying oncogenes is helpful for obtaining a good understanding of the formation and development of various types of cancers.
Methods
In this study, we proposed a computational method, called OPM, for investigating oncogenes from the view of Gene Ontology (GO) and biological pathways. All investigated genes, including validated oncogenes retrieved from some public databases and other genes that have not been reported to be oncogenes thus far, were encoded into numeric vectors according to the enrichment theory of GO terms and KEGG pathways. Some popular feature selection methods, minimum redundancy maximum relevance and incremental feature selection, and an advanced machine learning algorithm, random forest, were adopted to analyze the numeric vectors to extract key GO terms and KEGG pathways.
Results
Along with the oncogenes, GO terms and KEGG pathways were discussed in terms of their relevance in this study. Some important GO terms and KEGG pathways were extracted using feature selection methods and were confirmed to be highly related to oncogenes. Additionally, the importance of these terms and pathways in predicting oncogenes was further demonstrated by finding new putative oncogenes based on them.
Conclusions
This study investigated oncogenes based on GO terms and KEGG pathways. Some important GO terms and KEGG pathways were confirmed to be highly related to oncogenes. We hope that these GO terms and KEGG pathways can provide new insight for the study of oncogenes, particularly for building more effective prediction models to identify novel oncogenes. The program is available upon request.
General significance
We hope that the new findings listed in this study may provide a new insight for the investigation of oncogenes.},

ADHD is highly heritable, with a burden of large ({\textgreater}500 Kb) copy number variants (CNVs) identified among individuals with ADHD. However, how such CNVs exert their effects is poorly understood. We examined the genes affected by 71 large, rare, and predominantly inherited CNVs identified among 902 individuals with ADHD. We applied both mouse-knockout functional enrichment analyses, exploiting behavioral phenotypes arising from the determined disruption of 1:1 mouse orthologues, and human brain-specific spatio-temporal expression data to uncover molecular pathways common among genes contributing to enriched phenotypes. Twenty-two percent of genes duplicated in individuals with ADHD that had mouse phenotypic information were associated with abnormal learning/memory/conditioning (“l/m/c”) phenotypes. Although not observed in a second ADHD-cohort, we identified a similar enrichment among genes duplicated by eight de novo CNVs present in eight individuals with Hyperactivity and/or Short attention span (“Hyperactivity/SAS”, the ontologically-derived phenotypic components of ADHD). In the brain, genes duplicated in patients with ADHD and Hyperactivity/SAS and whose orthologues’ disruption yields l/m/c phenotypes in mouse (“candidate-genes”), were co-expressed with one another and with genes whose orthologues’ mouse models exhibit hyperactivity. Moreover, genes associated with hyperactivity in the mouse were significantly more co-expressed with ADHD candidate-genes than with similarly identified genes from individuals with intellectual disability. Our findings support an etiology for ADHD distinct from intellectual disability, and mechanistically related to genes associated with hyperactivity phenotypes in other mammalian species. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Cobalamin C (Cbl-C) defect is the most common inborn cobalamin metabolism error; it causes impaired conversion of dietary vitamin B12 into its two metabolically active forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Cbl-C defect causes the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine and decreased methionine synthesis. The gene responsible for the Cbl-C defect has been recently identified, and more than 40 mutations have been reported. MMACHC gene is located on chromosome 1p and catalyzes the reductive decyanation of CNCbl. Cbl-C patients present with a heterogeneous clinical picture and, based on their age at onset, can be categorized into two distinct clinical forms. Early-onset patients, presenting symptoms within the first year, show a multisystem disease with severe neurological, ocular, haematological, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and pulmonary manifestations. Late-onset patients present a milder clinical phenotype with acute or slowly progressive neurological symptoms and behavioral disturbances. To improve clinical course and metabolic abnormalities, treatment of Cbl-C defect usually consists of a combined approach that utilizes vitamin B12 to increase intracellular cobalamin and to maximize deficient enzyme activities, betaine to provide a substrate for the conversion of homocysteine into methionine through betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, and folic acid to enhance remethylation pathway. No proven efficacy has been demonstrated for carnitine and dietary protein restriction. Despite these measures, the long-term follow-up is unsatisfactory especially in patients with early onset, with frequent progression of neurological and ocular impairment. The unfavorable outcome suggests that better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease is needed to improve treatment protocols and to develop new therapeutic approaches.},

Although countless highly penetrant variants have been associated with Mendelian disorders, the genetic etiologies underlying complex diseases remain largely unresolved. By mining the medical records of over 110 million patients, we examine the extent to which Mendelian variation contributes to complex disease risk. We detect thousands of associations between Mendelian and complex diseases, revealing a nondegenerate, phenotypic code that links each complex disorder to a unique collection of Mendelian loci. Using genome-wide association results, we demonstrate that common variants associated with complex diseases are enriched in the genes indicated by this “Mendelian code.” Finally, we detect hundreds of comorbidity associations among Mendelian disorders, and we use probabilistic genetic modeling to demonstrate that Mendelian variants likely contribute nonadditively to the risk for a subset of complex diseases. Overall, this study illustrates a complementary approach for mapping complex disease loci and provides unique predictions concerning the etiologies of specific diseases.},

	abstract = {Despite great biological and computational efforts to determine the genetic causes underlying human heritable diseases, approximately half (3500) of these diseases are still without an identified genetic cause. Model organism studies allow the targeted modification of the genome and can help with the identification of genetic causes for human diseases. Targeted modifications have led to a vast amount of model organism data. However, these data are scattered across different databases, preventing an integrated view and missing out on contextual information. Once we are able to combine all the existing resources, will we be able to fully understand the causes underlying a disease and how species differ. Here, we present an integrated data resource combining tissue expression with phenotypes in mouse lines and bringing us one step closer to consequence chains from a molecular level to a resulting phenotype. Mutations in genes often manifest in phenotypes in the same tissue that the gene is expressed in. However, in other cases, a systems level approach is required to understand how perturbations to gene-networks connecting multiple tissues lead to a phenotype. Automated evaluation of the predicted tissue–phenotype associations reveals that 72–76\% of the phenotypes are associated with disruption of genes expressed in the affected tissue. However, 55–64\% of the individual phenotype–tissue associations show spatially separated gene expression and phenotype manifestation. For example, we see a correlation between ‘total body fat’ abnormalities and genes expressed in the ‘brain’, which fits recent discoveries linking genes expressed in the hypothalamus to obesity. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of our predicted tissue–phenotype associations can improve the detection of a known disease–gene association when combined with a disease gene candidate prediction tool. For example, JAK2, the known gene associated with Familial Erythrocytosis 1, rises from the seventh best candidate to the top hit when the associated tissues are taken into consideration.

Phevor works by combining knowledge resident in multiple biomedical ontologies with the outputs of variant-prioritization tools. It does so by using an algorithm that propagates information across and between ontologies. This process enables Phevor to accurately reprioritize potentially damaging alleles identified by variant-prioritization tools in light of gene function, disease, and phenotype knowledge. Phevor is especially useful for single-exome and family-trio-based diagnostic analyses, the most commonly occurring clinical scenarios and ones for which existing personal genome diagnostic tools are most inaccurate and underpowered. Here, we present a series of benchmark analyses illustrating Phevor’s performance characteristics. Also presented are three recent Utah Genome Project case studies in which Phevor was used to identify disease-causing alleles. Collectively, these results show that Phevor improves diagnostic accuracy not only for individuals presenting with established disease phenotypes but also for those with previously undescribed and atypical disease presentations. Importantly, Phevor is not limited to known diseases or known disease-causing alleles. As we demonstrate, Phevor can also use latent information in ontologies to discover genes and disease-causing alleles not previously associated with disease.},

	abstract = {Phevor integrates phenotype, gene function, and disease information with personal genomic data for improved power to identify disease-causing alleles. Phevor works by combining knowledge resident in multiple biomedical ontologies with the outputs of variant-prioritization tools. It does so by using an algorithm that propagates information across and between ontologies. This process enables Phevor to accurately reprioritize potentially damaging alleles identified by variant-prioritization tools in light of gene function, disease, and phenotype knowledge. Phevor is especially useful for single-exome and family-trio-based diagnostic analyses, the most commonly occurring clinical scenarios and ones for which existing personal genome diagnostic tools are most inaccurate and underpowered. Here, we present a series of benchmark analyses illustrating Phevor's performance characteristics. Also presented are three recent Utah Genome Project case studies in which Phevor was used to identify disease-causing alleles. Collectively, these results show that Phevor improves diagnostic accuracy not only for individuals presenting with established disease phenotypes but also for those with previously undescribed and atypical disease presentations. Importantly, Phevor is not limited to known diseases or known disease-causing alleles. As we demonstrate, Phevor can also use latent information in ontologies to discover genes and disease-causing alleles not previously associated with disease.},

	abstract = {Background
Targeted next-generation sequencing is playing an increasingly important role in biological research and clinical diagnosis by allowing researchers to sequence high priority genes at much higher depths and at a fraction of the cost of whole genome or exome sequencing. However, in designing the panel of genes to be sequenced, investigators need to consider the tradeoff between the better sensitivity of a broad panel and the higher specificity of a potentially more relevant panel. Although tools to prioritize candidate disease genes have been developed, the great majority of these require prior knowledge and a set of seed genes as input, which is only possible for diseases with a known genetic etiology.

Results
To meet the demands of both researchers and clinicians, we have developed a user-friendly website called SoftPanel. This website is intended to serve users by allowing them to input a single disorder or a disorder group and generate a panel of genes predicted to underlie the disorder of interest. Various methods of retrieval including a keyword search, browsing of an arborized list of International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes or using disorder phenotypic similarities can be combined to define a group of disorders and the genes known to be associated with them. Moreover, SoftPanel enables users to expand or refine a gene list by utilizing several biological data resources. In addition to providing users with the facility to create a “hard” panel that contains an exact gene list for targeted sequencing, SoftPanel also enables generation of a “soft” panel of genes, which may be used to further filter a significantly altered set of genes identified through whole genome or whole exome sequencing. The service and data provided by SoftPanel can be accessed at http://www.isb.pku.edu.cn/SoftPanel/. A tutorial page is included for trying out sample data and interpreting results.

Conclusion
SoftPanel provides a convenient and powerful tool for creating a targeted panel of potential disease genes while supporting different forms of input. SoftPanel may be utilized in both genomics research and personalized medicine.

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

In computer simulations, ranking genes based on the variant score put the true gene in first place less than 5\% of the time; PhenIX placed the correct gene in first place more than 86\% of the time. In a retrospective test of PhenIX on 52 patients with previously identified mutations and known diagnoses, the correct gene achieved a mean rank of 2.1. In a prospective study on 40 individuals without a diagnosis, PhenIX analysis enabled a diagnosis in 11 cases (28\%, at a mean rank of 2.4).

Gene prioritization aims to rank the most probable candidate genes towards the top of a list of potentially pathogenic variants. A promising new approach involves the computational comparison of the phenotypic abnormalities of the individual being investigated with those previously associated with human diseases or genetically modified model organisms.

Phenotype ontologies were developed to capture and compare phenotypes within the context of a single species. Recently, these ontologies were augmented with formal class definitions that may be utilized to integrate phenotypic data and enable the direct comparison of phenotypes between different species. We have developed a method to transform phenotype ontologies into a formal representation, combine phenotype ontologies with anatomy ontologies, and apply a measure of semantic similarity to construct the PhenomeNET cross-species phenotype network. We demonstrate that PhenomeNET can identify orthologous genes, genes involved in the same pathway and gene–disease associations through the comparison of mutant phenotypes. We provide evidence that the Adam19 and Fgf15 genes in mice are involved in the tetralogy of Fallot, and, using zebrafish phenotypes, propose the hypothesis that the mammalian homologs of Cx36.7 and Nkx2.5 lie in a pathway controlling cardiac morphogenesis and electrical conductivity which, when defective, cause the tetralogy of Fallot phenotype. Our method implements a whole-phenome approach toward disease gene discovery and can be applied to prioritize genes for rare and orphan diseases for which the molecular basis is unknown.},

However, many aberrations are novel or extremely rare, making clinical interpretation problematic and genotype-phenotype correlations uncertain. Identification of patients sharing a genomic rearrangement and having phenotypic features in common leads to greater certainty in the pathogenic nature of the rearrangement and enables new syndromes to be defined. To facilitate the analysis of these rare events, we have developed an interactive web-based database called DECIPHER (Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources) which incorporates a suite of tools designed to aid the interpretation of submicroscopic chromosomal imbalance, inversions, and translocations. DECIPHER catalogs common copy-number changes in normal populations and thus, by exclusion, enables changes that are novel and potentially pathogenic to be identified. DECIPHER enhances genetic counseling by retrieving relevant information from a variety of bioinformatics resources. Known and predicted genes within an aberration are listed in the DECIPHER patient report, and genes of recognized clinical importance are highlighted and prioritized. DECIPHER enables clinical scientists worldwide to maintain records of phenotype and chromosome rearrangement for their patients and, with informed consent, share this information with the wider clinical research community through display in the genome browser Ensembl. By sharing cases worldwide, clusters of rare cases having phenotype and structural rearrangement in common can be identified, leading to the delineation of new syndromes and furthering understanding of gene function.},

Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward—and successful—genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters. In addition to furthering genetic analysis, endophenotypes can clarify classification and diagnosis and foster the development of animal models.

Exploration of the genetic architecture of specific endophenotypes may be a powerful strategy for understanding the genetic basis of schizophrenia.Objective
To characterize the genetic architecture of some key endophenotypic measures selected for their reported heritabilities in schizophrenia.Design
Family-based heritability study.Setting
Seven sites across the United States.Participants
At the time of these initial data analyses, the members of 183 nuclear families ascertained through probands with schizophrenia had been assessed for these endophenotypes.Main Outcome Measures
Variance component models were used to assess the heritability of and the environmental and genetic correlations among the endophenotypes. The Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia assesses the neurophysiologic measures of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, P50 event-related potential suppression, and the antisaccade task for eye movements and the neurocognitive measures of the Continuous Performance Test (Degraded Stimulus version), the California Verbal Learning Test, the Letter-Number Sequencing test, and 6 measures from the University of Pennsylvania Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. The heritabilities of these 12 measures are the focus of this article.Results
All of the endophenotypes and the University of Pennsylvania Computerized Neurocognitive Battery measures were found to be significantly heritable (P ≤ .005), with heritabilities ranging from 24\% to 55\%. Significant environmental and genetic correlations were also observed between many of the endophenotypic measures.Conclusion
This is the first large-scale, multisite, family-based heritability study of a collection of endophenotypes for schizophrenia and suggests that endophenotypes are important measures to consider in characterizing the genetic basis of schizophrenia.},

The aim of the present study was to validate and characterize the cognitive data: to describe the inter-correlational structure of the cognitive variables at baseline assessment, and the degree of stability in scores across longitudinal assessment. Baseline cognitive data were used to examine the inter-correlational/factor-structure, using principal components analysis (PCA). We also assessed the degree of stability in cognitive scores in the subsample of participants with repeat data. The different tests of cognitive ability showed significant raw inter-correlations in the expected directions. PCA suggested a one-factor solution (eigenvalue = 1.60), which accounted for around 40\% of the variance. Scores showed varying levels of stability across time-points (intraclass correlation range = 0.16 to 0.65).

The DO web browser has been designed for speed, efficiency and robustness through the use of a graph database. Full-text contextual searching functionality using Lucene allows the querying of name, synonym, definition, DOID and cross-reference (xrefs) with complex Boolean search strings. The DO semantically integrates disease and medical vocabularies through extensive cross mapping and integration of MeSH, ICD, NCI's thesaurus, SNOMED CT and OMIM disease-specific terms and identifiers. The DO is utilized for disease annotation by major biomedical databases (e.g. Array Express, NIF, IEDB), as a standard representation of human disease in biomedical ontologies (e.g. IDO, Cell line ontology, NIFSTD ontology, Experimental Factor Ontology, Influenza Ontology), and as an ontological cross mappings resource between DO, MeSH and OMIM (e.g. GeneWiki). The DO project (http://diseaseontology.sf.net) has been incorporated into open source tools (e.g. Gene Answers, FunDO) to connect gene and disease biomedical data through the lens of human disease. The next iteration of the DO web browser will integrate DO's extended relations and logical definition representation along with these biomedical resource cross-mappings.},

Though in many cases experiments may be designed to minimize the occurrence of missing data, it is often unavoidable in practice; thus, statistical methods to account for missing data are needed. In this paper we describe an approach for conjoining multiple imputation and QTL mapping. Methods are applied to map genes associated with increased breathing effort in mice after lung inflammation due to allergen challenge in developing lines of the Collaborative Cross, a new mouse genetics resource. Missing data poses a particular challenge in this study because the desired phenotype summary to be mapped is a function of incompletely observed dose-response curves. Comparison of the multiple imputation approach to two naive approaches for handling missing data suggest that these simpler methods may yield poor results: ignoring missing data through a complete case analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions, while using a last observation carried forward procedure, which does not account for uncertainty in the imputed values, may lead to anti-conservative inference. The proposed approach is widely applicable to other studies with missing phenotype data.},

	abstract = {Background
The investigation of the interconnections between the molecular and genetic events that govern biological systems is essential if we are to understand the development of disease and design effective novel treatments. Microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to provide this information. However, taking full advantage of these approaches requires that biological connections be made across large quantities of highly heterogeneous genomic datasets. Leveraging the increasingly huge quantities of genomic data in the public domain is fast becoming one of the key challenges in the research community today.

Methodology/Results
We have developed a novel data mining framework that enables researchers to use this growing collection of public high-throughput data to investigate any set of genes or proteins. The connectivity between molecular states across thousands of heterogeneous datasets from microarrays and other genomic platforms is determined through a combination of rank-based enrichment statistics, meta-analyses, and biomedical ontologies. We address data quality concerns through dataset replication and meta-analysis and ensure that the majority of the findings are derived using multiple lines of evidence. As an example of our strategy and the utility of this framework, we apply our data mining approach to explore the biology of brown fat within the context of the thousands of publicly available gene expression datasets.

Conclusions
Our work presents a practical strategy for organizing, mining, and correlating global collections of large-scale genomic data to explore normal and disease biology. Using a hypothesis-free approach, we demonstrate how a data-driven analysis across very large collections of genomic data can reveal novel discoveries and evidence to support existing hypothesis.},

However, these studies have mostly analyzed one trait and one SNP at a time, thus failing to capture the underlying complexity of the data sets. Joint genotype-phenotype analyses of complex, high-dimensional data sets represent an important way to move beyond simple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with great potential. The move to high-dimensional phenotypes will raise many new statistical problems. Here we address the central issue of missing phenotypes in studies with any level of relatedness between samples. We propose a multiple-phenotype mixed model and use a computationally efficient variational Bayesian algorithm to fit the model. On a variety of simulated and real data sets from a range of organisms and trait types, we show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods from the statistics and machine learning literature and can boost signals of association.},

An underappreciated point is that MLMA can also increase power in studies without sample structure by implicitly conditioning on associated loci other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard MLMA approach have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost.

It has been widely adopted in genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies and, more recently, exome sequencing studies. However, significance testing in both genome-wide and exome-wide studies must adopt stringent significance thresholds to allow multiple testing, and it is useful only when studies have adequate statistical power, which depends on the characteristics of the phenotype and the putative genetic variant, as well as the study design. Here, we review the principles and applications of significance testing and power calculation, including recently proposed gene-based tests for rare variants.},

Phenotypes associated with engineered and natural genetic variation are widely recorded using phenotype ontologies in model organisms, as are signs and symptoms of human Mendelian diseases in databases such as OMIM and Orphanet. Exploiting these resources, several computational methods have been developed for integration and analysis of phenotype data to identify the genetic etiology of diseases or suggest plausible interventions. A similar resource would be highly useful not only for rare and Mendelian diseases, but also for common, complex and infectious diseases. We apply a semantic text-mining approach to identify the phenotypes (signs and symptoms) associated with over 6,000 diseases. We evaluate our text-mined phenotypes by demonstrating that they can correctly identify known disease-associated genes in mice and humans with high accuracy. Using a phenotypic similarity measure, we generate a human disease network in which diseases that have similar signs and symptoms cluster together, and we use this network to identify closely related diseases based on common etiological, anatomical as well as physiological underpinnings.},

	abstract = {Background
Plant phenotype datasets include many different types of data, formats, and terms from specialized vocabularies. Because these datasets were designed for different audiences, they frequently contain language and details tailored to investigators with different research objectives and backgrounds. Although phenotype comparisons across datasets have long been possible on a small scale, comprehensive queries and analyses that span a broad set of reference species, research disciplines, and knowledge domains continue to be severely limited by the absence of a common semantic framework.

Results
We developed a workflow to curate and standardize existing phenotype datasets for six plant species, encompassing both model species and crop plants with established genetic resources. Our effort focused on mutant phenotypes associated with genes of known sequence in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Arabidopsis), Zea mays L. subsp. mays (maize), Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrel medic or Medicago), Oryza sativa L. (rice), Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean), and Solanum lycopersicum L. (tomato). We applied the same ontologies, annotation standards, formats, and best practices across all six species, thereby ensuring that the shared dataset could be used for cross-species querying and semantic similarity analyses. Curated phenotypes were first converted into a common format using taxonomically broad ontologies such as the Plant Ontology, Gene Ontology, and Phenotype and Trait Ontology. We then compared ontology-based phenotypic descriptions with an existing classification system for plant phenotypes and evaluated our semantic similarity dataset for its ability to enhance predictions of gene families, protein functions, and shared metabolic pathways that underlie informative plant phenotypes.

Conclusions
The use of ontologies, annotation standards, shared formats, and best practices for cross-taxon phenotype data analyses represents a novel approach to plant phenomics that enhances the utility of model genetic organisms and can be readily applied to species with fewer genetic resources and less well-characterized genomes. In addition, these tools should enhance future efforts to explore the relationships among phenotypic similarity, gene function, and sequence similarity in plants, and to make genotype-to-phenotype predictions relevant to plant biology, crop improvement, and potentially even human health.

Semantic similarity measures over phenotype ontologies have been demonstrated to provide a powerful approach for the analysis of model organism phenotypes, the discovery of animal models of human disease, novel pathways, gene functions, druggable therapeutic targets, and determination of pathogenicity.

Results
We have developed PhenomeNET 2, a system that enables similarity-based searches over a large repository of phenotypes in real-time. It can be used to identify strains of model organisms that are phenotypically similar to human patients, diseases that are phenotypically similar to model organism phenotypes, or drug effect profiles that are similar to the phenotypes observed in a patient or model organism. PhenomeNET 2 is available at http://aber-owl.net/phenomenet.

Conclusions
Phenotype-similarity searches can provide a powerful tool for the discovery and investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying an observed phenotypic manifestation. PhenomeNET 2 facilitates user-defined similarity searches and allows researchers to analyze their data within a large repository of human, mouse and rat phenotypes.},

Many ontologies have been developed in biology and these ontologies increasingly contain large volumes of formalized knowledge commonly expressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Computational access to the knowledge contained within these ontologies relies on the use of automated reasoning.

Results
We have developed the Aber-OWL infrastructure that provides reasoning services for bio-ontologies. Aber-OWL consists of an ontology repository, a set of web services and web interfaces that enable ontology-based semantic access to biological data and literature. Aber-OWL is freely available at http://aber-owl.net.

Conclusions
Aber-OWL provides a framework for automatically accessing information that is annotated with ontologies or contains terms used to label classes in ontologies. When using Aber-OWL, access to ontologies and data annotated with them is not merely based on class names or identifiers but rather on the knowledge the ontologies contain and the inferences that can be drawn from it.},

We demonstrate that the simultaneous disruption of multiple functionally related genes is a frequent and significant characteristic of de novo CNVs in patients with developmental disorders (P = 1 × 10−3). Using three different functional networks, we identified unexpectedly large numbers of functionally related genes within de novo CNVs from two large independent cohorts of individuals with developmental disorders. The presence of multiple functionally related genes was a significant predictor of a CNV's pathogenicity when compared to CNVs from apparently healthy individuals and a better predictor than the presence of known disease or haploinsufficient genes for larger CNVs. The functionally related genes found in the de novo CNVs belonged to 70\% of all clusters of functionally related genes found across the genome. De novo CNVs were more likely to affect functional clusters and affect them to a greater extent than benign CNVs (P = 6 × 10−4). Furthermore, such clusters of functionally related genes are phenotypically informative: Different patients possessing CNVs that affect the same cluster of functionally related genes exhibit more similar phenotypes than expected (P {\textless} 0.05). The spanning of multiple functionally similar genes by single CNVs contributes substantially to how these variants exert their pathogenic effects.},

A number of genes that vary in copy number in ASD patients have been identified, many of which were known to function at the neuronal synapse. We theorised that in some cases the dosage change of multiple genes simultaneously, rather than singularly, may lead to faulty neuronal development, and contribute to ASD. To test this, we asked whether alterations in these candidate genes would cause neuronal synapse and sleep/rest changes using the fruit fly  Drosophila , and validated this model using single-gene models. We considered the simultaneous change of pairs of genes that were jointly affected by a large human copy number variant (CNVs), which are structural changes in the genome. In three of four CNVs, mutations in subsets of genes synergistically interacted to cause neuronal changes comparable to the single gene candidates. We also observed that the changes in synapse size followed the direction of the human gene copy number change. Finally, we show that different interactions affect the development of the synapse through different mechanisms, allowing us to identify distinct molecular alterations that illuminate the etiological heterogeneity of ASD.},

We theorised that in some cases the dosage change of multiple genes simultaneously, rather than singularly, may lead to faulty neuronal development, and contribute to ASD. To test this, we asked whether alterations in these candidate genes would cause neuronal synapse and sleep/rest changes using the fruit fly  Drosophila , and validated this model using single-gene models. We considered the simultaneous change of pairs of genes that were jointly affected by a large human copy number variant (CNVs), which are structural changes in the genome. In three of four CNVs, mutations in subsets of genes synergistically interacted to cause neuronal changes comparable to the single gene candidates. We also observed that the changes in synapse size followed the direction of the human gene copy number change. Finally, we show that different interactions affect the development of the synapse through different mechanisms, allowing us to identify distinct molecular alterations that illuminate the etiological heterogeneity of ASD.},

	abstract = {Author Summary   Developmental disorders occur in ∼3\% of live births, and exhibit a broad range of abnormalities including: intellectual disability, autism, heart defects, and other neurological and morphological problems. Often, patients are grouped into genetic syndromes which are defined by a specific set of mutations and a common set of abnormalities. However, many mutations are unique to a single patient and many patients present a range of abnormalities which do not fit one of the recognized genetic syndromes, making diagnosis difficult. Using a dataset of 197 patients with systematically described abnormalities, we identified molecular pathways whose disruption was associated with specific abnormalities among many patients. Importantly, patients with mutations in the same pathway often exhibited similar co-morbid symptoms and thus the commonly disrupted pathway appeared responsible for the broad range of shared abnormalities amongst these patients. These findings support the general concept that patients with mutations in distinct genes could be etiologically grouped together through the common pathway that these mutated genes participate in, with a view to improving diagnoses, prognoses and therapeutic outcomes.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood onset disorder, prevalent in 5.3\% of children and 1–4\% of adults. ADHD is highly heritable, with a burden of large ({\textgreater}500 Kb) copy number variants (CNVs) identified among individuals with ADHD. However, how such CNVs exert their effects is poorly understood. We examined the genes affected by 71 large, rare, and predominantly inherited CNVs identified among 902 individuals with ADHD. We applied both mouse‐knockout functional enrichment analyses, exploiting behavioral phenotypes arising from the determined disruption of 1:1 mouse orthologues, and human brain‐specific spatio‐temporal expression data to uncover molecular pathways common among genes contributing to enriched phenotypes. Twenty‐two percent of genes duplicated in individuals with ADHD that had mouse phenotypic information were associated with abnormal learning/memory/conditioning (“l/m/c”) phenotypes. Although not observed in a second ADHD‐cohort, we identified a similar enrichment among genes duplicated by eight de novo CNVs present in eight individuals with Hyperactivity and/or Short attention span (“Hyperactivity/SAS”, the ontologically‐derived phenotypic components of ADHD). In the brain, genes duplicated in patients with ADHD and Hyperactivity/SAS and whose orthologues’ disruption yields l/m/c phenotypes in mouse (“candidate‐genes”), were co‐expressed with one another and with genes whose orthologues’ mouse models exhibit hyperactivity. Moreover, genes associated with hyperactivity in the mouse were significantly more co‐expressed with ADHD candidate‐genes than with similarly identified genes from individuals with intellectual disability. Our findings support an etiology for ADHD distinct from intellectual disability, and mechanistically related to genes associated with hyperactivity phenotypes in other mammalian species. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Author Summary   Plenty of gene variants have been associated with a disease, yet most of the heritability, along with the molecular basis, of common diseases remains unexplained. However, it is widely thought that the products of genes whose mutations are implicated in the same disease function together in the same biological pathways and it is the disruption of these pathways that underlies the disease. Such pathways are not well defined and their identification could help elucidate disease mechanisms. Consequently, groupwise functional analyses of gene variants to identify common disease-relevant pathways are becoming standard in next-generation sequencing studies, but we find that these analyses are confounded by coding-sequence length bias. We control for these bias and describe a phenotype-based approach which outperforms other methods in discerning functional associations among the disease-associated genes. We also demonstrate the suitability of this method to functionally dissect the gene variants underlying a complex disorder, the identified functional clusters offering insight into disease mechanisms.},

However, while equivalences in the DNA sequence of two species may be readily inferred through evolutionary models, the identification of equivalence in the phenotypic consequences resulting from comparable genetic variation is far from straightforward, limiting the value of the modelling paradigm. In this review, we provide an overview of the emerging statistical and computational approaches to objectively identify phenotypic equivalence between human and model organisms with examples from the vertebrate models, mouse and zebrafish. Firstly, we discuss enrichment approaches, which deem the most frequent phenotype among the orthologues of a set of genes associated with a common human phenotype as the orthologous phenotype, or phenolog, in the model species. Secondly, we introduce and discuss computational reasoning approaches to identify phenotypic equivalences made possible through the development of intra- and interspecies ontologies. Finally, we consider the particular challenges involved in modelling neuropsychiatric disorders, which illustrate many of the remaining difficulties in developing comprehensive and unequivocal interspecies phenotype mappings.},

	abstract = {Copy number variants (CNVs) are thought to underlie many human developmental abnormalities. However, it is unclear how many of these CNVs exert their pathogenic effects or, in particular, how distinct CNVs at dispersed loci can give rise to the same abnormality. We hypothesize that the mouse orthologs of genes whose copy number change gives rise to the same human abnormality might also yield a similar phenotype when disrupted in mice. Thus, by bringing together a large number of disparate CNVs, we may be able to identify an unusually overrepresented phenotype among the affected genes' mouse orthologs. We obtained 1,624 de novo CNVs identified in patients with developmental abnormalities from Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources and European Cytogeneticists Association Register of Unbalanced Chromosome Aberrations database. Forming CNV sets for each of 1,088 distinct human abnormalities, we were able to associate a total of 143 (13\%) human abnormalities with mouse model phenotypes. Although many mouse phenotypes are readily comparable to their associated human abnormality, others are less so, generating novel biological hypotheses. Of the 2,086 candidate genes that contribute to these associations, 65\% have not been previously associated with human disease in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and their distribution suggests both extensive pleiotropy and epistasis while also proposing a small number of simple additive consequences.

Using this integrated resource, we show that ID-AGs are substantially enriched with co-expression, protein-protein interactions, and specific biological functions. Systematic identification of highly enriched functional themes and phenotypes revealed typical phenotype combinations characterizing process-defined groups of ID disorders, such as chromatin-related disorders and deficiencies in DNA repair. Strikingly, phenotype classification efficiently breaks down ID-AGs into subsets with significantly elevated biological coherence and predictive power. Custom-made functional Drosophila datasets revealed further characteristic phenotypes among ID-AGs and specific clinical classes. Our study and resource provide systematic insights into the molecular and clinical landscape of ID disorders, represent a significant step toward overcoming current limitations in ID research, and prove the utility of systematic human and cross-species phenomics analyses in highly heterogeneous genetic disorders.},

	abstract = {With the advent of modern imaging and measurement technology, complex phenotypes are increasingly represented by large numbers of measurements, which may not bear biological meaning one by one. For such multivariate phenotypes, studying the pairwise associations between all measurements and all alleles is highly inefficient and prevents insight into the genetic pattern underlying the observed phenotypes. We present a new method for identifying patterns of allelic variation (genetic latent variables) that are maximally associated—in terms of effect size—with patterns of phenotypic variation (phenotypic latent variables). This multivariate genotype–phenotype mapping (MGP) separates phenotypic features under strong genetic control from less genetically determined features and thus permits an analysis of the multivariate structure of genotype–phenotype association, including its dimensionality and the clustering of genetic and phenotypic variables within this association. Different variants of MGP maximize different measures of genotype–phenotype association: genetic effect, genetic variance, or heritability. In an application to a mouse sample, scored for 353 SNPs and 11 phenotypic traits, the first dimension of genetic and phenotypic latent variables accounted for {\textgreater}70\% of genetic variation present in all 11 measurements; 43\% of variation in this phenotypic pattern was explained by the corresponding genetic latent variable. The first three dimensions together sufficed to account for almost 90\% of genetic variation in the measurements and for all the interpretable genotype–phenotype association. Each dimension can be tested as a whole against the hypothesis of no association, thereby reducing the number of statistical tests from 7766 to 3—the maximal number of meaningful independent tests. Important alleles can be selected based on their effect size (additive or nonadditive effect on the phenotypic latent variable). This low dimensionality of the genotype–phenotype map has important consequences for gene identification and may shed light on the evolvability of organisms.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, researchers have characterized a set of "clock genes" that drive daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. This arduous work has yielded results with far-reaching consequences in metabolic, psychiatric, and neoplastic disorders. Recent attempts to expand our understanding of circadian regulation have moved beyond the mutagenesis screens that identified the first clock components, employing higher throughput genomic and proteomic techniques. In order to further accelerate clock gene discovery, we utilized a computer-assisted approach to identify and prioritize candidate clock components. We used a simple form of probabilistic machine learning to integrate biologically relevant, genome-scale data and ranked genes on their similarity to known clock components. We then used a secondary experimental screen to characterize the top candidates. We found that several physically interact with known clock components in a mammalian two-hybrid screen and modulate in vitro cellular rhythms in an immortalized mouse fibroblast line (NIH 3T3). One candidate, Gene Model 129, interacts with BMAL1 and functionally represses the key driver of molecular rhythms, the BMAL1/CLOCK transcriptional complex. Given these results, we have renamed the gene CHRONO (computationally highlighted repressor of the network oscillator). Bi-molecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrate that CHRONO represses by abrogating the binding of BMAL1 to its transcriptional co-activator CBP. Most importantly, CHRONO knockout mice display a prolonged free-running circadian period similar to, or more drastic than, six other clock components. We conclude that CHRONO is a functional clock component providing a new layer of control on circadian molecular dynamics.},

'Modulation factors' associated with E-boxes, ROR-elements, and D-boxes can explain variable rhythms of CCGs, which is demonstrated for differential regulation of cytochromes P450 and 12 h harmonics.

To test whether insulin acts as a synchronizer for the hepatic clock by cell-autonomous mechanisms, the phase-resetting capabilities of insulin were investigated in cultured hepatic cells. We provide evidence that three-dimensional (3D) cell culture conditions that preserve the differentiated state of primary hepatocytes sustained the robustness of the molecular clock, while this robustness rapidly dampened under classical monolayer cell culture conditions. Herein, we established a 3D cell culture system coupled with a real-time luciferase reporter, and demonstrated that insulin directly regulates the phase entrainment of hepatocyte circadian oscillators. We found that insulin-deficient diabetic rats had a pronounced phase advance in their hepatic clock. Subsequently, a single administration of insulin induced phase-dependent bi-directional phase shifts in diabetic rat livers. Our results clearly demonstrate that insulin is a liver clock synchronizer.},

As daily food anticipation (FA) is independent of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the central pacemaker of the circadian system, questions arise of where FA signals originate and what role components of the circadian clock might play. Here we show that liver-specific deletion of Per2 in mice abolishes FA, an effect that is rescued by viral overexpression of Per2 in the liver. RNA sequencing indicates that Per2 regulates β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB) production to induce FA leading to the conclusion that liver Per2 is important for this process. Unexpectedly, we show that FA originates in the liver and not in the brain. However, manifestation of FA involves processing of the liver-derived βOHB signal in the brain, indicating that the food-entrainable oscillator is not located in a single tissue but is of systemic nature.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify cluster structures in high-dimensional datasets, such as those obtained in DNA microarray and quantitative proteomics experiments. One of its main limitations is the lack of a computationally fast method to set optimal values of algorithm parameters. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of purely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data. The optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not yield any results for a purely random dataset but which detects cluster formation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness.
Results: Estimation of the optimal parameter values is achieved by evaluation of the results of the clustering procedure applied to randomized datasets. In this case, the optimal value of the fuzzifier follows common rules that depend only on the main properties of the dataset. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of objects as input values instead of evaluating the entire dataset allows us to propose a functional relationship determining the fuzzifier directly. This result speaks strongly against using a predefined fuzzifier as typically done in many previous studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation of the optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance between the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better than those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.

	abstract = {Background: Circadian rhythms play an integral role in human behavior, physiology and health. Individual differences in daily rhythms (chronotypes) can affect individual sleep-wake cycles, activity patterns and behavioral choices. Diurnal preference, the tendency towards morningness or eveningness among individuals, has been associated with interpersonal variation in circadian clock-related output measures, including body temperature, melatonin levels and clock gene mRNA in blood, oral mucosa, and dermal fibroblast cell cultures.Methods: Here we report gene expression data from two principal clock genes sampled from hair follicle cells, a peripheral circadian clock. Hair follicle cells from fourteen individuals of extreme morning or evening chronotype were sampled at three time points. RNA was extracted and quantitative PCR assays were used to measure mRNA expression patterns of two clock genes, Per3 and Nr1d2.Results: We found significant differences in clock gene expression over time between chronotype groups, independent of gender or age of participants. Extreme evening chronotypes have a delay in phase of circadian clock gene oscillation relative to extreme morning types. Variation in the molecular clockwork of chronotype groups represents nearly three-hour phase differences (Per3: 2.61 hours; Nr1d2: 3.08 hours, both: 2.86) in circadian oscillations of these clock genes.Conclusions: The measurement of gene expression from hair follicles at three time points allows for a direct, efficient method of estimating phase shifts of a peripheral circadian clock in real-life conditions. The robust phase differences in temporal expression of clock genes associated with diurnal preferences provide the framework for further studies of the molecular mechanisms and gene-by-environment interactions underlying chronotype-specific behavioral phenomena, including social jetlag.},

	abstract = {Since hub nodes have been found to play important roles in many networks, highly connected hub genes are expected to play an important role in biology as well. However, the empirical evidence remains ambiguous. An open question is whether (or when) hub gene selection leads to more meaningful gene lists than a standard statistical analysis based on significance testing when analyzing genomic data sets (e.g., gene expression or DNA methylation data). Here we address this question for the special case when multiple genomic data sets are available. This is of great practical importance since for many research questions multiple data sets are publicly available. In this case, the data analyst can decide between a standard statistical approach (e.g., based on meta-analysis) and a co-expression network analysis approach that selects intramodular hubs in consensus modules. We assess the performance of these two types of approaches according to two criteria. The first criterion evaluates the biological insights gained and is relevant in basic research. The second criterion evaluates the validation success (reproducibility) in independent data sets and often applies in clinical diagnostic or prognostic applications. We compare meta-analysis with consensus network analysis based on weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) in three comprehensive and unbiased empirical studies: (1) Finding genes predictive of lung cancer survival, (2) finding methylation markers related to age, and (3) finding mouse genes related to total cholesterol. The results demonstrate that intramodular hub gene status with respect to consensus modules is more useful than a meta-analysis p-value when identifying biologically meaningful gene lists (reflecting criterion 1). However, standard meta-analysis methods perform as good as (if not better than) a consensus network approach in terms of validation success (criterion 2). The article also reports a comparison of meta-analysis techniques applied to gene expression data and presents novel R functions for carrying out consensus network analysis, network based screening, and meta analysis.},

To reveal the finer details of circadian variation in the mammalian SCN transcriptome we combined laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-seq over a 24 hr light / dark cycle. We show that 7-times more genes exhibited a classic sinusoidal expression signature than previously observed in the SCN. Another group of 766 genes unexpectedly peaked twice, near both the start and end of the dark phase; this twin-peaking group is significantly enriched for synaptic transmission genes that are crucial for light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. 341 intergenic non-coding RNAs, together with novel exons of annotated protein-coding genes, including Cry1, also show specific circadian expression variation. Overall, our data provide an important chronobiological resource (www.wgpembroke.com/shiny/SCNseq/) and allow us to propose that transcriptional timing in the SCN is gating clock resetting mechanisms., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10518.001, The daily cycles of life in mammals are driven by a small region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (or SCN). The SCN receives signals from sunlight and other environmental factors to help coordinate most aspects of daily biological activity and behaviour. To work correctly, it is essential that the SCN switches certain genes on and off at exactly the right time. However, many questions remain over the identity of these genes and how their levels of activity change during a 24-hour period., When a gene is active (or “being expressed”), it is used as a template to build the molecules of RNA that are needed to make proteins and to help to control how cells work. Pembroke et al. have now sequenced the RNA molecules made in the SCN of mice (which plays the same role as the equivalent human brain region) over a 24-hour period. The mice spent half of each day in the light, and half in the dark. This revealed that the expression levels of over a quarter of all the genes that are found in the SCN fluctuate over a 24-hour period. One particular group of genes peak in activity twice a day; Pembroke et al. suggest that these genes are important for controlling how an animal can adjust its body clock to light., Further research is now needed to find out which of the newly discovered fluctuating genes play the most important roles in daily activity rhythms, and which might play a part in disease., DOI:

An early morning increase in FBG levels, which is pronounced among diabetic patients, is known as the dawn phenomenon. Although the intracellular circadian clock generates various molecular rhythms, whether the hepatic clock is involved in FBG rhythm remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of phase shift and disruption of the hepatic clock on the FBG rhythm. In both C57BL/6J and diabetic ob/ob mice, FBG exhibited significant daily rhythms with a peak at the beginning of the dark phase. Light-phase restricted feeding altered the phase of FBG rhythm mildly in C57BL/6J mice and greatly in ob/ob mice, in concert with the phase shifts of mRNA expression rhythms of the clock and glucose production–related genes in the liver. Moreover, the rhythmicity of FBG and Glut2 expression was not detected in liver-specific Bmal1-deficient mice. Furthermore, treatment with octreotide suppressed the plasma growth hormone concentration but did not affect the hepatic mRNA expression of the clock genes or the rise in FBG during the latter half of the resting phase in C57BL/6J mice. These results suggest that the hepatic circadian clock plays a critical role in regulating the daily FBG rhythm, including the dawn phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Objective
Detecting discords in time series is a special novelty detection task that has found many interesting applications. Unlike the traditional novelty detection methods which can make use of a separate set of normal samples to build up the model, discord detection is often provided with mixed data containing both normal and abnormal data. The objective of this work is to present an effective method to detect discords in unsynchronized periodic time series data.
Methods
The task of discord detection is considered as a problem of unsupervised learning with noise data. A new clustering algorithm named weighted spherical 1-mean with phase shift (PS-WS1M) is proposed in this work. It introduces a phase adjustment procedure into the iterative clustering process and produces a set of anomaly scores based upon which an unsupervised approach is employed to locate the discords automatically. A theoretical analysis on the robustness and convergence of PS-WS1M is also given.
Results
The proposed algorithm is evaluated via real-world electrocardiograms datasets extracted from the MIT-BIH database. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and competitive for the problem of discord detection in periodic time series. Meanwhile, the robustness of PS-WS1M is also experimentally verified. As compared to some of the other discord detection methods, the proposed algorithm can always achieve ideal FScore values with most of which exceeding 0.98.
Conclusion
The proposed PS-WS1M algorithm allows the integration of a phase adjustment procedure into the iterative clustering process and it can be successfully applied to detect discords in time series.},

	abstract = {We use the multigenic pattern of gene expression across suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) regions and time to understand the dynamics within the SCN in response to a circadian phase-resetting light pulse. Global gene expression studies of the SCN indicate that circadian functions like phase resetting are complex multigenic processes. While the molecular dynamics of phase resetting are not well understood, it is clear they involve a “functional gene expression program”, e.g., the coordinated behavior of functionally related genes in space and time. In the present study we selected a set of 89 of these functionally related genes in order to further understand this multigenic program. By use of high-throughput qPCR we studied 52 small samples taken by anatomically precise laser capture from within the core and shell SCN regions, and taken at time points with and without phase resetting light exposure. The results show striking regional differences in light response to be present in the mouse SCN. By using network-based analyses, we are able to establish a highly specific multigenic correlation between genes expressed in response to light at night and genes normally activated during the day. The light pulse triggers a complex and highly coordinated network of gene regulation. The largest differences marking neuroanatomical location are in transmitter receptors, and the largest time-dependent differences occur in clock-related genes. Nighttime phase resetting appears to recruit transcriptional regulatory processes normally active in the day. This program, or mechanism, causes the pattern of core region gene expression to transiently shift to become more like that of the shell region.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transcriptomes of several cyanobacterial strains have been shown to exhibit diurnal oscillation patterns, reflecting the diurnal phototrophic lifestyle of the organisms. The analysis of such genome-wide transcriptional oscillations is often facilitated by the use of clustering algorithms in conjunction with a number of pre-processing steps. Biological interpretation is usually focussed on the time and phase of expression of the resulting groups of genes. However, the use of microarray technology in such studies requires the normalization of pre-processing data, with unclear impact on the qualitative and quantitative features of the derived information on the number of oscillating transcripts and their respective phases.
RESULTS: A microarray based evaluation of diurnal expression in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is presented. As expected, the temporal expression patterns reveal strong oscillations in transcript abundance. We compare the Fourier transformation-based expression phase before and after the application of quantile normalization, median polishing, cyclical LOESS, and least oscillating set (LOS) normalization. Whereas LOS normalization mostly preserves the phases of the raw data, the remaining methods introduce systematic biases. In particular, quantile-normalization is found to introduce a phase-shift of 180°, effectively changing night-expressed genes into day-expressed ones. Comparison of a large number of clustering results of differently normalized data shows that the normalization method determines the result. Subsequent steps, such as the choice of data transformation, similarity measure, and clustering algorithm, only play minor roles. We find that the standardization and the DTF transformation are favorable for the clustering of time series in contrast to the 12 m transformation. We use the cluster-wise functional enrichment of a clustering derived by LOS normalization, clustering using flowClust, and DFT transformation to derive the diurnal biological program of Synechocystis sp..
CONCLUSION: Application of quantile normalization, median polishing, and also cyclic LOESS normalization of the presented cyanobacterial dataset lead to increased numbers of oscillating genes and the systematic shift of the expression phase. The LOS normalization minimizes the observed detrimental effects. As previous analyses employed a variety of different normalization methods, a direct comparison of results must be treated with caution.},

Variation in chronotype has been linked to sleep disorders, cognitive and physical performance, and chronic disease. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported chronotype within the UKBiobank cohort (n=100,420). We identify 12 new genetic loci that implicate known components of the circadian clock machinery and point to previously unstudied genetic variants and candidate genes that might modulate core circadian rhythms or light-sensing pathways. Pathway analyses highlight central nervous and ocular systems and fear-response related processes. Genetic correlation analysis suggests chronotype shares underlying genetic pathways with schizophrenia, educational attainment and possibly BMI. Further, Mendelian randomization suggests that evening chronotype relates to higher educational attainment.

	abstract = {Disrupted circadian rhythms and reduced sleep duration are associated with several human diseases, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes, but little is known about the genetic factors influencing these heritable traits. We performed genome-wide association studies of self-reported chronotype (morning/evening person) and self-reported sleep duration in 128,266 White British individuals from the UK Biobank study. Sixteen variants were associated with chronotype (P{\textless}5x10-8), including variants near the known circadian rhythm genes RGS16 (1.21 odds of morningness [95\%CI 1.15, 1.27], P=3x10-12) and PER2 (1.09 odds of morningness [95\%CI 1.06, 1.12], P=4x10-10). The PER2 signal has previously been associated with iris function. We sought replication using self-reported data from 89,823 23andMe participants; thirteen of the chronotype signals remained significant at P{\textless}5x10-8 on meta-analysis and eleven of these reached P{\textless}0.05 in the same direction in the 23andMe study. For sleep duration, we replicated one known signal in PAX8 (2.6 [95\%CIs 1.9, 3.2] minutes per allele P=5.7x10-16) and identified and replicated two novel associations at VRK2 (2.0 [95\% CI: 1.3, 2.7] minutes per allele, P=1.2x10-9; and 1.6 [95\% CI: 1.1, 2.2] minutes per allele, P=7.6x10-9). Although we found genetic correlation between chronotype and BMI (rG=0.056, P=0.048); undersleeping and BMI (rG=0.147, P=1x10-5) and oversleeping and BMI (rG=0.097, P=0.039), Mendelian Randomisation analyses provided no consistent evidence of causal associations between BMI or type 2 diabetes and chronotype or sleep duration.

	doi = {10.1109/ISB.2014.6990756},
	abstract = {Monitoring the changes in gene expression patterns over time provides the distinct possibility of unraveling the mechanistic drivers characterizing cellular responses. Such time series gene expression data allow us to broadly “watch” the dynamics of the system. However, one challenge in the analysis of time series data is to establish and characterize the interplay between genes that are activated, deactivated or sustained in the context of a biological process or functional category. To address such challenges, novel algorithms are required to improve the interpretation of these data by integrating multi-source prior functional evidence. In this paper, we introduced a novel network-based approach to extract functional knowledge from time-dependent biological processes at a system level using time series mRNA deep sequencing data. First, a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at each time point was identified. Second, GO terms that are enriched in each DEG list were identified. Third, the significance of interactions between DEGs in these GO terms at consecutive time points was measured. Finally, the significant interactions between DEGs in different GO terms were used to construct the interaction networks among GO terms between two consecutive time points, called GO networks. The proposed method was applied to investigate 1α, 25(OH)2D3-altered mechanisms in zebrafish embryo development. GO networks were constructed over 4 consecutive time points. Results suggest that biological processes such as cartilage development and one-carbon compound metabolic process are temporally regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3. Such discoveries could not have been identified with canonical gene set enrichment analyses. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide insight on the molecular mechanisms taking place in vertebrate embryo development upon treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3. Our approach enables the monitoring of biological processes that can serve as a basis for generating new testable hypotheses. Such network-based integration approach can be easily extended to any temporal- or condition-dependent genomic data analyses.},

	abstract = {Background
Differences in gene expression drive phenotypic differences between species, yet major organs and tissues generally have conserved gene expression programs. Several comparative transcriptomic studies have observed greater similarity in gene expression between homologous tissues from different vertebrate species than between diverse tissues of the same species. However, a recent study by Lin and colleagues reached the opposite conclusion. These studies differed in the species and tissues analyzed, and in technical details of library preparation, sequencing, read mapping, normalization, gene sets, and clustering methods.

Results
To better understand gene expression evolution we reanalyzed data from four studies, including that of Lin, encompassing 6–13 tissues each from 11 vertebrate species using standardized mapping, normalization, and clustering methods. An analysis of independent data showed that the set of tissues chosen by Lin et al. were more similar to each other than those analyzed by previous studies. Comparing expression in five common tissues from the four studies, we observed that samples clustered exclusively by tissue rather than by species or study, supporting conservation of organ physiology in mammals. Furthermore, inter-study distances between homologous tissues were generally less than intra-study distances among different tissues, enabling informative meta-analyses. Notably, when comparing expression divergence of tissues over time to expression variation across 51 human GTEx tissues, we could accurately predict the clustering of expression for arbitrary pairs of tissues and species.

Conclusions
These results provide a framework for the design of future evolutionary studies of gene expression and demonstrate the utility of comparing RNA-seq data across studies.

Children with intellectual disability (ID) tend to have sleep-wake disturbances, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Given that sleep is partly controlled by the circadian clock, we decided to study the rhythmic expression of genes in the hippocampus, a brain structure which plays a key role in memory in humans and rodents.

By investigating the hippocampal transcriptome of adult mice, we identified 663 circadian clock controlled (CCC) genes, which we divided into four categories based on their temporal pattern of expression. In addition to the standard core clock genes, enrichment analysis identified several transcription factors among these hippocampal CCC genes, and our findings suggest that genes from one cluster regulate the expression of those in another. Interestingly, these hippocampal CCC genes were highly enriched in sleep/wakefulness-related genes. We show here that several genes in the glucocorticoid signaling pathway, which is involved in memory, show a CCC pattern of expression. However, ID genes were not enriched among these CCC genes, suggesting that sleep or learning and memory disturbances observed in patients with ID are probably not related to the circadian clock in the hippocampus.},

All ENCODE experimental data, metadata and associated computational analyses are submitted to the ENCODE Data Coordination Center (DCC) for validation, tracking, storage and distribution to community resources and the scientific community. As the volume of data increases, the organization of experimental details becomes increasingly complicated and demands careful curation to identify related experiments.

We discuss how ontologies, when used to annotate metadata, provide improved searching capabilities and facilitate the ability to find connections within a set of experiments. Additionally, we provide examples of how ontologies are used to annotate ENCODE metadata and how the annotations can be identified via ontology-driven searches at the ENCODE portal.

Ontologies, as abstract description systems for domain-specific knowledge composition, hence receive more and more attention in computational biology and bioinformatics. Particularly, many applications relying on domain ontologies require quantitative measures of relationships between terms in the ontologies, making it indispensable to develop computational methods for the derivation of ontology-based semantic similarity between terms. Nevertheless, with a variety of methods available, how to choose a suitable method for a specific application becomes a problem. With this understanding, we review a majority of existing methods that rely on ontologies to calculate semantic similarity between terms. We classify existing methods into five categories: methods based on semantic distance, methods based on information content, methods based on properties of terms, methods based on ontology hierarchy, and hybrid methods. We summarize characteristics of each category, with emphasis on basic notions, advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Further, we extend our review to software tools implementing these methods and applications using these methods.},

	abstract = {Background
The development of next generation sequencing technology is rapidly changing the face of the genome annotation and analysis field. One of the primary uses for genome sequence data is to improve our understanding and prediction of phenotypes for microbes and microbial communities, but the technologies for predicting phenotypes must keep pace with the new sequences emerging.
Scope of review
This review presents an integrated view of the methods and technologies used in the inference of phenotypes for microbes and microbial communities based on genomic and metagenomic data. Given the breadth of this topic, we place special focus on the resources available within the SEED Project. We discuss the two steps involved in connecting genotype to phenotype: sequence annotation, and phenotype inference, and we highlight the challenges in each of these steps when dealing with both single genome and metagenome data.
Major conclusions
This integrated view of the genotype-to-phenotype problem highlights the importance of a controlled ontology in the annotation of genomic data, as this benefits subsequent phenotype inference and metagenome annotation. We also note the importance of expanding the set of reference genomes to improve the annotation of all sequence data, and we highlight metagenome assembly as a potential new source for complete genomes. Finally, we find that phenotype inference, particularly from metabolic models, generates predictions that can be validated and reconciled to improve annotations.
General significance
This review presents the first look at the challenges and opportunities associated with the inference of phenotype from genotype during the next generation sequencing revolution. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Systems Biology of Microorganisms.},

Through the application of genetic engineering and mutagenesis techniques, the number of unique mutant mouse models and the amount of phenotypic data describing them are growing exponentially. Describing phenotypes of mutant mice in a computationally useful manner that will facilitate data mining is a major challenge for bioinformatics. Here we describe a tool, the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP), for classifying and organizing phenotypic information related to the mouse and other mammalian species. The MP Ontology has been applied to mouse phenotype descriptions in the Mouse Genome Informatics Database (MGI, http://www.informatics.jax.org/), the Rat Genome Database (RGD, http://rgd.mcw.edu), the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA, http://omia.angis.org.au/) and elsewhere. Use of this ontology allows comparisons of data from diverse sources, can facilitate comparisons across mammalian species, assists in identifying appropriate experimental disease models, and aids in the discovery of candidate disease genes and molecular signaling pathways.},

This Review summarizes the current knowledge of lncRNAs as regulators of the endocrine system, with a focus on the identification and mode of action of several endocrine-important lncRNAs. We highlight lncRNAs that have a role in the development and function of pancreatic β cells, white and brown adipose tissue, and other endocrine organs, and discuss the involvement of these molecules in endocrine dysfunction (for example, diabetes mellitus). We also address the associations of lncRNAs with nuclear receptors involved in major hormonal signalling pathways, such as estrogen and androgen receptors, and the relevance of these associations in certain endocrine cancers.},

	abstract = {Motivation: A number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified by deep sequencing methods, but their molecular and cellular functions are known only for a limited number of lncRNAs. Current databases on lncRNAs are mostly for cataloging purpose without providing in-depth information required to infer functions. A comprehensive resource on lncRNA function is an immediate need.
Results: We present a database for functional investigation of lncRNAs that encompasses annotation, sequence analysis, gene expression, protein binding and phylogenetic conservation. We have compiled lncRNAs for six species (human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm and yeast) from ENSEMBL, HGNC, MGI and lncRNAdb. Each lncRNA was analyzed for coding potential and phylogenetic conservation in different lineages. Gene expression data of 208 RNA-Seq studies (4995 samples), collected from GEO, ENCODE, modENCODE and TCGA databases, were used to provide expression profiles in various tissues, diseases and developmental stages. Importantly, we analyzed RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed mRNAs that would provide ample insights on lncRNA functions. The resulting gene list can be subject to enrichment analysis such as Gene Ontology or KEGG pathways. Furthermore, we compiled protein–lncRNA interactions by collecting and analyzing publicly available CLIP-seq or PAR-CLIP sequencing data. Finally, we explored evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs with correlated expression between human and six other organisms to identify functional lncRNAs. The whole contents are provided in a user-friendly web interface.

In the mouse liver, circadian transcriptional rhythms are necessary for metabolic homeostasis. Whether dynamic epigenomic modifications are associated with transcript oscillations has not been systematically investigated. We found that several antisense RNA, lincRNA, and microRNA transcripts also showed circadian oscillations in adult mouse livers. Robust transcript oscillations often correlated with rhythmic histone modifications in promoters, gene bodies, or enhancers, although promoter DNA methylation levels were relatively stable. Such integrative analyses identified oscillating expression of an antisense transcript (asPer2) to the gene encoding the circadian oscillator component Per2. Robust transcript oscillations often accompanied rhythms in multiple histone modifications and recruitment of multiple chromatin-associated clock components. Coupling of cycling histone modifications with nearby oscillating transcripts thus established a temporal relationship between enhancers, genes, and transcripts on a genome-wide scale in a mammalian liver. The results offer a framework for understanding the dynamics of metabolism, circadian clock, and chromatin modifications involved in metabolic homeostasis.},

The circadian transcription in the liver is clustered in phase and this is accompanied by circadian occupancy of RNA polymerase II recruitment and initiation.

	abstract = {Evolved under the selective pressures of a 24-h world, circadian timekeeping mechanisms are present in virtually all living organisms to coordinate daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. Until recently, the circadian clock was modeled as simple, interlocked transcription–translation feedback loops driving rhythms in gene expression of a handful of core clock genes. However, it has become evident that circadian clock regulation is immensely more complex than once thought and involves posttranscriptional, translational and posttranslational mechanisms. In particular, there has been a growing awareness of the vital role played by microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating various aspects of circadian clock function. In this review, we will summarize our current knowledge of miRNA-dependent regulation of the circadian timing system in multiple organisms, including flies, mammals and higher plants. We will also discuss future perspectives for research on the role of miRNAs and noncoding RNAs in circadian regulation of health and disease.},

While it is widely acknowledged that the rate of biological processes may vary between individuals, data analysis approaches that go beyond evaluating differential expression of single genes have so far not taken this variability into account. To this end, we introduce here a robust multi-gene data analysis approach and evaluate it in a biomarker discovery scenario across four publicly available datasets. In our evaluation, existing methods perform surprisingly poorly on time-resolved data; only the approach taking the variability into account yields reproducible and biologically plausible results. Our results indicate the need to capture gene expression between potentially heterogeneous individuals at multiple time points, and highlight the importance of robust data analysis in the presence of heterogeneous gene expression responses.},

We describe a computational approach that integrates GRO-seq and RNA-seq data to annotate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), with increased sensitivity for low-abundance lncRNAs. We used this approach to characterize the lncRNA transcriptome in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, including \&gt;700 previously unannotated lncRNAs. We then used information about the (1) transcription of lncRNA genes from GRO-seq, (2) steady-state levels of lncRNA transcripts in cell lines and patient samples from RNA-seq, and (3) histone modifications and factor binding at lncRNA gene promoters from ChIP-seq to explore lncRNA gene structure and regulation, as well as lncRNA transcript stability, regulation, and function. Functional analysis of selected lncRNAs with altered expression in breast cancers revealed roles in cell proliferation, regulation of an E2F-dependent cell-cycle gene expression program, and estrogen-dependent mitogenic growth. Collectively, our studies demonstrate the use of an integrated genomic and molecular approach to identify and characterize growth-regulating lncRNAs in cancers.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

ABCA1 is an essential regulator of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and reverse cholesterol transport — a role that determines its importance for atherosclerosis. Over the last 10 years studies have provided convincing evidence that ABCA1, via its control of apoE lipidation, also has a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A series of reports have revealed a significant impact of ABCA1 on Aβ deposition and clearance in AD model mice, as well as an association of common and rare ABCA1 gene variants with the risk for AD. Since APOE is the major genetic risk factor for late onset AD, the regulation of apoE level or its functionality by ABCA1 may prove significant for AD pathogenesis. ABCA1 is transcriptionally regulated by Liver X Receptors (LXR) and Retinoic X Receptors (RXR) which provides a starting point for drug discovery and development of synthetic LXR and RXR agonists for treatment of metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the recent results of research on ABCA1, particularly relevant to atherosclerosis and AD.},

Synthetic data were used to evaluate how each algorithm responds to different curve shapes, periods, phase shifts, noise levels and sampling rates. The biological datasets we tested represent a variety of periodic processes from different organisms, including the cell cycle and metabolic cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, circadian rhythms in Mus musculus and the root clock in Arabidopsis thaliana.
RESULTS: From these results, we discovered that each algorithm had different strengths. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for selecting and applying these methods depending on the nature of the data and the periodic patterns of interest. Additionally, these results can also be used to inform the design of large-scale biological rhythm experiments so that the resulting data can be used with these algorithms to detect periodic signals more effectively.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock generates daily rhythms in mammalian liver processes, such as glucose and lipid homeostasis, xenobiotic metabolism, and regeneration. The mechanisms governing these rhythms are not well understood, particularly the distinct contributions of the cell-autonomous clock and central pacemaker to rhythmic liver physiology. Through microarray expression profiling in Met murine hepatocytes (MMH)-D3, we identified over 1,000 transcripts that exhibit circadian oscillations, demonstrating that the cell-autonomous clock can drive many rhythms, and that MMH-D3 is a valid circadian model system. The genes represented by these circadian transcripts displayed both cophasic and antiphasic organization within a protein-protein interaction network, suggesting the existence of competition for binding sites or partners by genes of disparate transcriptional phases. Multiple pathways displayed enrichment in MMH-D3 circadian transcripts, including the polyamine synthesis module of the glutathione metabolic pathway. The polyamine synthesis module, which is highly associated with cell proliferation and whose products are required for initiation of liver regeneration, includes enzymes whose transcripts exhibit circadian oscillations, such as ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase. Metabolic profiling revealed that the enzymatic product of spermidine synthase, spermidine, cycles as well. Thus, the cell-autonomous hepatocyte clock can drive a significant amount of transcriptional rhythms and orchestrate physiologically relevant modules such as polyamine synthesis.},

To reveal the finer details of circadian variation in the mammalian SCN transcriptome we combined laser-capture microdissection and RNA-seq over a 24-hour light/dark cycle. We show that 7-times more genes exhibited a classic sinusoidal expression signature than previously observed in the SCN. Another group of 766 genes unexpectedly peaked twice, near both the start and end of the dark phase; this twin-peaking group is significantly enriched for synaptic transmission genes that are crucial for light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. 341 intergenic non-coding RNAs, together with novel exons of annotated protein-coding genes, including Cry1, also show specific circadian expression variation. Overall, our data provide an important chronobiological resource (www.wgpembroke.com/shiny/SCNseq/) and allow us to propose that transcriptional timing in the SCN is gating clock resetting mechanisms.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btq534},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify cluster structures in high-dimensional datasets, such as those obtained in DNA microarray and quantitative proteomics experiments. One of its main limitations is the lack of a computationally fast method to set optimal values of algorithm parameters. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of purely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data. The optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not yield any results for a purely random dataset but which detects cluster formation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness.
RESULTS: Estimation of the optimal parameter values is achieved by evaluation of the results of the clustering procedure applied to randomized datasets. In this case, the optimal value of the fuzzifier follows common rules that depend only on the main properties of the dataset. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of objects as input values instead of evaluating the entire dataset allows us to propose a functional relationship determining the fuzzifier directly. This result speaks strongly against using a predefined fuzzifier as typically done in many previous studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation of the optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance between the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better than those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.},

	doi = {10.1160/TH12-04-0273},
	abstract = {The Aα, Bβ and γ polypeptide chains of fibrinogen are encoded by a three gene cluster on human chromosome four. The fibrinogen genes (FGB-FGA-FGG) are expressed almost exclusively in hepatocytes where their output is coordinated to ensure a sufficient mRNA pool for each chain and maintain an abundant plasma fibrinogen protein level. Fibrinogen gene expression is controlled by the activity of proximal promoters which contain binding sites for hepatocyte transcription factors, including proteins which influence fibrinogen transcription in response to acute-phase inflammatory stimuli. The fibrinogen gene cluster also contains cis regulatory elements; enhancer sequences with liver activities identified by sequence conservation and functional genomics. While the transcriptional control of this gene cluster is fascinating biology, the medical impetus to understand fibrinogen gene regulation stems from the association of cardiovascular disease risk with high level circulating fibrinogen. In the general population this level varies from about 1.5 to 3.5 g/l. This variation between individuals is influenced by genotype, suggesting there are genetic variants contributing to fibrinogen levels which reside in fibrinogen regulatory loci. A complete picture of how fibrinogen genes are regulated will therefore point towards novel sources of regulatory variants. In this review we discuss regulation of the fibrinogen genes from proximal promoters and enhancers, the influence of acute-phase stimulation, post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs and functional regulatory variants identified in genetic studies. Finally, we discuss the fibrinogen locus in light of recent advances in understanding chromosomal architecture and suggest future directions for researching the mechanisms that control fibrinogen expression.},

Apolipoproteins play a well-established role in the transport and metabolism of lipids within the CNS; however, evidence is emerging that they also fulfill a number of functions that extend beyond lipid transport and are critical for healthy brain function. The importance of apolipoproteins in brain physiology is highlighted by genetic studies, where apolipoprotein gene polymorphisms have been identified as risk factors for several neurological diseases. Furthermore, the expression of brain apolipoproteins is significantly altered in several brain disorders. The purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date assessment of the major apolipoproteins found in the brain (ApoE, ApoJ, ApoD and ApoA-I), covering their proposed roles and the factors influencing their level of expression.

	abstract = {ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (encoded by ABCA1) regulates cholesterol efflux from cells to apolipoproteins A-I and E (ApoA-I and APOE; encoded by APOA1 and APOE, respectively) and the generation of high density lipoproteins. In Abca1 knockout mice (Abca1(ko)), high density lipoproteins and ApoA-I are virtually lacking, and total APOE and APOE-containing lipoproteins in brain substantially decreased. As the ε4 allele of APOE is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, ABCA1 role as a modifier of APOE lipidation is of significance for this disease. Reportedly, Abca1 deficiency in mice expressing human APP accelerates amyloid deposition and behaviour deficits. We used APP/PS1dE9 mice crossed to Apoe and Apoa1 knockout mice to generate Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout mice. We hypothesized that Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout mice would mimic the phenotype of APP/Abca1(ko) mice in regards to amyloid plaques and cognitive deficits. Amyloid pathology, peripheral lipoprotein metabolism, cognitive deficits and dendritic morphology of Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout mice were compared to APP/Abca1(ko), APP/PS1dE9, and single Apoa1 and Apoe knockouts. Contrary to our prediction, the results demonstrate that double deletion of Apoe and Apoa1 ameliorated the amyloid pathology, including amyloid plaques and soluble amyloid. In double knockout mice we show that (125)I-amyloid-β microinjected into the central nervous system cleared at a rate twice faster compared to Abca1 knockout mice. We tested the effect of Apoe, Apoa1 or Abca1 deficiency on spreading of exogenous amyloid-β seeds injected into the brain of young pre-depositing APP mice. The results show that lack of Abca1 augments dissemination of exogenous amyloid significantly more than the lack of Apoe. In the periphery, Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout mice exhibited substantial atherosclerosis and very high levels of low density lipoproteins compared to APP/PS1dE9 and APP/Abca1(ko). Plasma level of amyloid-β42 measured at several time points for each mouse was significantly higher in Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout then in APP/Abca1(ko) mice. This result demonstrates that mice with the lowest level of plasma lipoproteins, APP/Abca1(ko), have the lowest level of peripheral amyloid-β. Unexpectedly, and independent of amyloid pathology, the deletion of both apolipoproteins worsened behaviour deficits of double knockout mice and their performance was undistinguishable from those of Abca1 knockout mice. Finally we observed that the dendritic complexity in the CA1 region of hippocampus but not in CA2 is significantly impaired by Apoe/Apoa1 double deletion as well as by lack of ABCA1.
IN CONCLUSION: (i) plasma lipoproteins may affect amyloid-β clearance from the brain by the 'peripheral sink' mechanism; and (ii) deficiency of brain APOE-containing lipoproteins is of significance for dendritic complexity and cognition.},

At a molecular level, these oscillations are generated by transcriptional–translational feedback loops composed of core clock genes. In turn, core clock genes drive the rhythmic accumulation of downstream outputs—termed clock-controlled genes (CCGs)—whose rhythmic translation and function ultimately underlie daily oscillations at a cellular and organismal level. Given the circadian clock's profound influence on human health and behavior, considerable efforts have been made to systematically identify CCGs. The recent development of next-generation sequencing has dramatically expanded our ability to study the expression, processing, and stability of rhythmically expressed mRNAs. Nevertheless, like any new technology, there are many technical issues to be addressed. Here, we discuss considerations for studying circadian rhythms using genome scale transcriptional profiling, with a particular emphasis on RNA sequencing. We make a number of practical recommendations—including the choice of sampling density, read depth, alignment algorithms, read-depth normalization, and cycling detection algorithms—based on computational simulations and our experience from previous studies. We believe that these results will be of interest to the circadian field and help investigators design experiments to derive most values from these large and complex data sets.},

These transcriptional rhythms underlie oscillations of protein abundance, thereby mediating circadian rhythms of behavior, physiology, and metabolism. Numerous studies over the last decade have used microarrays to profile circadian transcriptional rhythms in various organisms and tissues. Here we use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile the circadian transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster brain from wild-type and period-null clock-defective animals. We identify several hundred transcripts whose abundance oscillates with 24-h periods in either constant darkness or 12 h light/dark diurnal cycles, including several noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that were not identified in previous microarray studies. Of particular interest are U snoRNA host genes (Uhgs), a family of diurnal cycling noncoding RNAs that encode the precursors of more than 50 box-C/D small nucleolar RNAs, key regulators of ribosomal biogenesis. Transcriptional profiling at the level of individual exons reveals alternative splice isoforms for many genes whose relative abundances are regulated by either period or circadian time, although the effect of circadian time is muted in comparison to that of period. Interestingly, period loss of function significantly alters the frequency of RNA editing at several editing sites, suggesting an unexpected link between a key circadian gene and RNA editing. We also identify tens of thousands of novel splicing events beyond those previously annotated by the modENCODE Consortium, including several that affect key circadian genes. These studies demonstrate extensive circadian control of ncRNA expression, reveal the extent of clock control of alternative splicing and RNA editing, and provide a novel, genome-wide map of splicing in Drosophila brain.},

PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses.

Besides standard multiple testing corrections, a new improved method for estimating the true effect of multiple testing over complex structures like GO has been introduced. Interpreting ranked gene lists is supported from the same interface with very efficient algorithms. Such ordered lists may arise when studying the most significantly affected genes from high-throughput data or genes co-expressed with the query gene. Other important aspects of practical data analysis are supported by modules tightly integrated with g:Profiler. These are: g:Convert for converting between different database identifiers; g:Orth for finding orthologous genes from other species; and g:Sorter for searching a large body of public gene expression data for co-expression. g:Profiler supports 31 different species, and underlying data is updated regularly from sources like the Ensembl database.

In such cases, the belonging of an object to a class is a matter of degree, as is the question of whether or not a group of objects form a cluster. A pioneering application of the theory of fuzzy sets to cluster analysis was made in 1969 by Ruspini. It was not until 1973, however, when the appearance of the work by Dunn and Bezdek on the Fuzzy ISODATA (or fuzzy c-means) algorithms became a landmark in the theory of cluster analysis, that the relevance of the theory of fuzzy sets to cluster analysis and pattern recognition became clearly established. Since then, the theory of fuzzy clustering has developed rapidly and fruitfully, with the author of the present monograph contributing a major share of what we know today. In their seminal work, Bezdek and Dunn have introduced the basic idea of determining the fuzzy clusters by minimizing an appropriately defined functional, and have derived iterative algorithms for computing the membership functions for the clusters in question. The important issue of convergence of such algorithms has become much better understood as a result of recent work which is described in the monograph.},

	abstract = {Background
There are some limitations associated with conventional clustering methods for short time-course gene expression data. The current algorithms require prior domain knowledge and do not incorporate information from replicates. Moreover, the results are not always easy to interpret biologically.

Results
We propose a novel algorithm for identifying a subset of genes sharing a significant temporal expression pattern when replicates are used. Our algorithm requires no prior knowledge, instead relying on an observed statistic which is based on the first and second order differences between adjacent time-points. Here, a pattern is predefined as the sequence of symbols indicating direction and the rate of change between time-points, and each gene is assigned to a cluster whose members share a similar pattern. We evaluated the performance of our algorithm to those of K-means, Self-Organizing Map and the Short Time-series Expression Miner methods.

Conclusions
Assessments using simulated and real data show that our method outperformed aforementioned algorithms. Our approach is an appropriate solution for clustering short time-course microarray data with replicates.},

These interactions arise as a result of the three-dimensional (3D) conformation of chromosomes in the cell nucleus. This 3D conformation can also result in the co-localization of co-regulated genes. To investigate this, we asked whether genome-wide chromatin interactions can predict co-expression patterns of genes. To address this question, we characterized 3D interactions between genes, captured by Hi-C measurements, by a network, termed chromatin interaction network (CIN). We applied scale-aware topological measures to the network to comprehensively characterize the chromatin interactions at different scales, ranging from direct interaction between gene pairs to chromatin compartment interactions. We then used multi-scale chromatin interactions to predict spatial co-expression patterns in the mouse cortex. The results show that the prediction performance improves when scale-aware topological measures of the multi-resolution chromatin interaction network are used.},

These transcriptional rhythms underlie oscillations of protein abundance, thereby mediating circadian rhythms of behavior, physiology, and metabolism. Numerous studies over the last decade have used microarrays to profile circadian transcriptional rhythms in various organisms and tissues. Here we use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile the circadian transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster brain from wild-type and period-null clock-defective animals. We identify several hundred transcripts whose abundance oscillates with 24-h periods in either constant darkness or 12 h light/dark diurnal cycles, including several noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that were not identified in previous microarray studies. Of particular interest are U snoRNA host genes (Uhgs), a family of diurnal cycling noncoding RNAs that encode the precursors of more than 50 box-C/D small nucleolar RNAs, key regulators of ribosomal biogenesis. Transcriptional profiling at the level of individual exons reveals alternative splice isoforms for many genes whose relative abundances are regulated by either period or circadian time, although the effect of circadian time is muted in comparison to that of period. Interestingly, period loss of function significantly alters the frequency of RNA editing at several editing sites, suggesting an unexpected link between a key circadian gene and RNA editing. We also identify tens of thousands of novel splicing events beyond those previously annotated by the modENCODE Consortium, including several that affect key circadian genes. These studies demonstrate extensive circadian control of ncRNA expression, reveal the extent of clock control of alternative splicing and RNA editing, and provide a novel, genome-wide map of splicing in Drosophila brain.},

In the mouse liver, circadian transcriptional rhythms are necessary for metabolic homeostasis. Whether dynamic epigenomic modifications are associated with transcript oscillations has not been systematically investigated. We found that several antisense RNA, lincRNA, and microRNA transcripts also showed circadian oscillations in adult mouse livers. Robust transcript oscillations often correlated with rhythmic histone modifications in promoters, gene bodies, or enhancers, although promoter DNA methylation levels were relatively stable. Such integrative analyses identified oscillating expression of an antisense transcript (asPer2) to the gene encoding the circadian oscillator component Per2. Robust transcript oscillations often accompanied rhythms in multiple histone modifications and recruitment of multiple chromatin-associated clock components. Coupling of cycling histone modifications with nearby oscillating transcripts thus established a temporal relationship between enhancers, genes, and transcripts on a genome-wide scale in a mammalian liver. The results offer a framework for understanding the dynamics of metabolism, circadian clock, and chromatin modifications involved in metabolic homeostasis.},

Genetic and genomic analysis suggests that a relatively small number of output genes are directly regulated by core oscillator components.

In several model organisms and man, circadian clock genes have been characterized and found to be transcription factors. Because of this, researchers have used microarrays to characterize global regulation of gene expression and algorithmic approaches to detect cycling. Here we present a new algorithm, JTK\_CYCLE, designed to efficiently identify and characterize cycling variables in large datasets. Compared to COSOPT and the Fisher’s G test, two commonly used methods for detecting cycling transcripts, JTK\_CYCLE distinguishes between rhythmic and non-rhythmic transcripts more reliably and efficiently. We also show that JTK\_CYCLE’s increased resistance to outliers results in considerably greater sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, JTK\_CYCLE accurately measures the period, phase, and amplitude of cycling transcripts, facilitating downstream analyses. Finally, it is several orders of magnitude faster than COSOPT, making it ideal for large scale data sets. We used JTK\_CYCLE to analyze legacy data sets including NIH3T3 cells, which have comparatively low amplitude. JTK\_CYCLE’s improved power led to the identification of a novel cluster of RNA-interacting genes whose abundance is under clear circadian regulation. These data suggest that JTK\_CYCLE is an ideal tool for identifying and characterizing oscillations in genome-scale datasets.},

	abstract = {Background
While twin and adoption studies point to substantial genetic influence upon alcohol use, dependence, and other alcohol-related phenotypes, few of the genes underlying variation in these phenotypes have been identified. Markers in genes related to GABAergic activity—a system integral to many of alcohol’s biological effects—have been implicated in alcohol use and alcohol-related psychopathology in linkage and association studies.

Methods
Using multiple methods, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the effects of markers in GABA system genes in a community-based sample of 7224 individuals assessed in early and middle adulthood. In addition to testing the effect of individual SNP markers on alcohol-related phenotypes, we computed a polygenic score reflecting the aggregated effects of multiple GABA system SNPs. We also estimated the variance in alcohol-related phenotypes attributable to all GABA system markers considered simultaneously, and conducted gene-based association tests.

Results
No method produced results indicative of an effect of GABA system variants on measures of alcohol use or misuse.

Conclusions
These results reflect alcohol-related behaviors in a population-representative sample, many of whom are still in adolescence, and in which the incidence of heavy drinking and alcohol-related symptomatology are relatively low. Contrasted with existing studies of the association between alcohol use and GABA system genes, our results suggest that the relationship may be limited to particular contexts, such as when accompanied by polysubstance abuse, or a familial history of alcoholism.},

	abstract = {A large number of cis-regulatory sequences have been annotated in the human genome, but defining their target genes remains a challenge. One strategy is to identify the long-range looping interactions at these elements with the use of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques. However, previous studies lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C). We determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5–10-kb resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of promoter–enhancer contacts after TNF-α signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly, we found that TNF-α-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional chromatin landscape, once established in a particular cell type, is relatively stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner.},

We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although {\textgreater}90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads.

Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

	abstract = {The vast non-coding portion of the human genome is full of functional elements and disease-causing regulatory variants. The principles defining the relationships between these elements and distal target genes remain unknown. Promoters and distal elements can engage in looping interactions that have been implicated in gene regulation. Here we have applied chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) to interrogate comprehensively interactions between transcription start sites (TSSs) and distal elements in 1\% of the human genome representing the ENCODE pilot project regions. 5C maps were generated for GM12878, K562 and HeLa-S3 cells and results were integrated with data from the ENCODE consortium. In each cell line we discovered {\textgreater}1,000 long-range interactions between promoters and distal sites that include elements resembling enhancers, promoters and CTCF-bound sites. We observed significant correlations between gene expression, promoter-enhancer interactions and the presence of enhancer RNAs. Long-range interactions show marked asymmetry with a bias for interactions with elements located ∼120 kilobases upstream of the TSS. Long-range interactions are often not blocked by sites bound by CTCF and cohesin, indicating that many of these sites do not demarcate physically insulated gene domains. Furthermore, only ∼7\% of looping interactions are with the nearest gene, indicating that genomic proximity is not a simple predictor for long-range interactions. Finally, promoters and distal elements are engaged in multiple long-range interactions to form complex networks. Our results start to place genes and regulatory elements in three-dimensional context, revealing their functional relationships.},

We demonstrate here that active and inactive genes are engaged in many long-range intrachromosomal interactions and can also form interchromosomal contacts. The active -globin locus in fetal liver preferentially contacts transcribed, but not necessarily tissue-specific, loci elsewhere on chromosome 7, whereas the inactive locus in fetal brain contacts different transcriptionally silent loci. A housekeeping gene in a gene-dense region on chromosome 8 forms long-range contacts predominantly with other active gene clusters, both in cis and in trans, and many of these intra- and interchromosomal interactions are conserved between the tissues analyzed. Our data demonstrate that chromosomes fold into areas of active chromatin and areas of inactive chromatin and establish 4C technology as a powerful tool to study nuclear architecture.},

	abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

	abstract = {The mammalian circadian system, which is comprised of multiple cellular clocks located in the organs and tissues, orchestrates their regulation in a hierarchical manner throughout the 24 hr of the day. At the top of the hierarchy are the suprachiasmatic nuclei, which synchronize subordinate organ and tissue clocks using electrical, endocrine, and metabolic signaling pathways that impact the molecular mechanisms of cellular clocks. The interplay between the central neural and peripheral tissue clocks is not fully understood and remains a major challenge in determining how neurological and metabolic homeostasis is achieved across the sleep-wake cycle. Disturbances in the communication between the plethora of body clocks can desynchronize the circadian system, which is believed to contribute to the development of diseases such as obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders. This review will highlight the relationship between clocks and metabolism, and describe how cues such as light, food, and reward mediate entrainment of the circadian system.},

ZFHX3 regulates transcription via direct interaction with predicted AT motifs in target genes. The mutant protein has a decreased ability to activate consensus AT motifs in vitro. Using RNA sequencing, we found minimal effects on core clock genes in Zfhx3(Sci/+) SCN, whereas the expression of neuropeptides critical for SCN intercellular signaling was significantly disturbed. Moreover, mutant ZFHX3 had a decreased ability to activate AT motifs in the promoters of these neuropeptide genes. Lentiviral transduction of SCN slices showed that the ZFHX3-mediated activation of AT motifs is circadian, with decreased amplitude and robustness of these oscillations in Zfhx3(Sci/+) SCN slices. In conclusion, by cloning Zfhx3(Sci), we have uncovered a circadian transcriptional axis that determines the period and robustness of behavioral and SCN molecular rhythms.},

	abstract = {Most of the human genome is transcribed, yielding a complex network of transcripts that includes tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs. Many of these transcripts have a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail, yet some of the most abundant long noncoding RNAs are processed in unexpected ways and lack these canonical structures. Here, I highlight the mechanisms by which several of these well-characterized noncoding RNAs are generated, stabilized, and function. The MALAT1 and MEN β (NEAT1\_2) long noncoding RNAs each accumulate to high levels in the nucleus, where they play critical roles in cancer progression and the formation of nuclear paraspeckles, respectively. Nevertheless, MALAT1 and MEN β are not polyadenylated as the tRNA biogenesis machinery generates their mature 3' ends. In place of a poly(A) tail, these transcripts are stabilized by highly conserved triple helical structures. Sno-lncRNAs likewise lack poly(A) tails and instead have snoRNA structures at their 5' and 3' ends. Recent work has additionally identified a number of abundant circular RNAs generated by the pre-mRNA splicing machinery that are resistant to degradation by exonucleases. As these various transcripts use non-canonical strategies to ensure their stability, it is becoming increasingly clear that long noncoding RNAs may often be regulated by unique post-transcriptional control mechanisms.

	abstract = {An efficient low redundancy DNA sequencing strategy should allow high accuracy determination of the consensus sequence on both strands of a DNA fragment from a minimal number of sequencing reactions with minimal overlap. At EMBL we developed a directed strategy for cosmid-scale sequencing based on primer walking, whereas most other sequencing projects of this scale rely on the random 'shotgun' strategy. In our strategy, highly accurate raw data are obtained from automated double-stranded Sanger dideoxy sequencing with inexpensive walking primers (8 to 10 \$ per primer), T7 DNA polymerase and internal labelling by fluorescein-15- dATP on A.L.F. DNA sequencers (Pharmacia Biotech). The use of 60-cm long glass plates enables reading length of up to 1000 bases. Comparing various random and directed sequencing strategies in the course of the European Community yeast genome sequencing project on cosmids from chromosomes IX, XI and XV, primer walking was found to be the strategy resulting in the lowest possible redundancy of 2.6 to 2.8. Future development of the sequencing strategy is based on the new EMBL 2-dye sequencing device for simultaneous sequencing on both strands, and implementation of an initial limited random sequencing phase to reduce the number of walking primers required by a factor of 3, while still maintaining a low redundancy of approx. 3.},

Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites.
RESULTS: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.
AVAILABILITY: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu.

Here we profiled the transcriptome of primary brown and white adipocytes, preadipocytes, and cultured adipocytes and identified 175 lncRNAs that are specifically regulated during adipogenesis. Many lncRNAs are adipose-enriched, strongly induced during adipogenesis, and bound at their promoters by key transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα). RNAi-mediated loss of function screens identified functional lncRNAs with varying impact on adipogenesis.

While, fetal wounds heal without scarring, a normal "fine line" scar is the clinical outcome of an undisturbed wound healing in adults. Alterations in the orchestrated wound healing process result in hypertrophic or keloid scarring. Research in the past decades attempted to identify genetic, cellular, and molecular factors responsible for these alterations. These attempts lead to several new developments in treatments for keloids, such as, imiquimod, inhibition of transforming growth factor beta, and recombinant interleukin-10. The urgent need for better therapeutics is underlined by recent data substantiating an impaired quality of life in keloid and hypertrophic scar patients. Despite the increasing knowledge about the molecular regulation of scar formation no unifying theory explaining keloid development has been put forward until today. This review aims to give an overview about the genetic and molecular background of keloids and focus of the current research on keloid scarring with special emphasis on new forthcoming treatments.

	abstract = {Certain protein-design calculations involve using an experimentally determined high-resolution structure as a template to identify new sequences that can adopt the same fold. This approach has led to the successful design of many novel, well-folded, native-like proteins. Although any atomic-resolution structure can serve as a template in such calculations, most successful designs have used high-resolution crystal structures. Because there are many proteins for which crystal structures are not available, it is of interest whether nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) templates are also appropriate. We have analyzed differences between using X-ray and NMR templates in side-chain repacking and design calculations. We assembled a database of 29 proteins for which both a high-resolution X-ray structure and an ensemble of NMR structures are available. Using these pairs, we compared the rotamericity, χ1-angle recovery, and native-sequence recovery of X-ray and NMR templates. We carried out design using RosettaDesign on both types of templates, and compared the energies and packing qualities of the resulting structures. Overall, the X-ray structures were better templates for use with Rosetta. However, for ∼20\% of proteins, a member of the reported NMR ensemble gave rise to designs with similar properties. Re-evaluating RosettaDesign structures with other energy functions indicated much smaller differences between the two types of templates. Ultimately, experiments are required to confirm the utility of particular X-ray and NMR templates. But our data suggest that the lack of a high-resolution X-ray structure should not preclude attempts at computational design if an NMR ensemble is available. Proteins 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Its gene-centric content is automatically mined and integrated from over 80 digital sources, resulting in a web-based deep-linked card for each of {\textgreater}73 000 human gene entries, encompassing the following categories: protein coding, pseudogene, RNA gene, genetic locus, cluster and uncategorized. We now introduce GeneCards Version 3, featuring a speedy and sophisticated search engine and a revamped, technologically enabling infrastructure, catering to the expanding needs of biomedical researchers. A key focus is on gene-set analyses, which leverage GeneCards’ unique wealth of combinatorial annotations. These include the GeneALaCart batch query facility, which tabulates user-selected annotations for multiple genes and GeneDecks, which identifies similar genes with shared annotations, and finds set-shared annotations by descriptor enrichment analysis. Such set-centric features address a host of applications, including microarray data analysis, cross-database annotation mapping and gene-disorder associations for drug targeting. We highlight the new Version 3 database architecture, its multi-faceted search engine, and its semi-automated quality assurance system. Data enhancements include an expanded visualization of gene expression patterns in normal and cancer tissues, an integrated alternative splicing pattern display, and augmented multi-source SNPs and pathways sections. GeneCards now provides direct links to gene-related research reagents such as antibodies, recombinant proteins, DNA clones and inhibitory RNAs and features gene-related drugs and compounds lists. We also portray the GeneCards Inferred Functionality Score annotation landscape tool for scoring a gene’s functional information status.

We show that antisense artifacts appear to be triggered by spurious synthesis of second-strand cDNA during reverse transcription reactions. Strand-specific hybridization signals obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae tiling arrays were compared between samples prepared with and without ActD. Use of ActD removed about half of the detectable antisense transcripts, consistent with their being artifacts, while sense expression levels and about 200 antisense transcripts were not affected. Our findings thus facilitate a more accurate assessment of the extent and position of antisense transcription, towards a better understanding of its role in cells.},

	abstract = {Besides soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC), the receptor for NO, there are at least seven plasma membrane enzymes that synthesize the second-messenger cGMP. All membrane GCs (GC-A through GC-G) share a basic topology, which consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a short transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain that contains the catalytic (GC) region. Although the presence of the extracellular domain suggests that all these enzymes function as receptors, specific ligands have been identified for only three of them (GC-A through GC-C). GC-A mediates the endocrine effects of atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides regulating arterial blood pressure and volume homeostasis and also local antihypertrophic actions in the heart. GC-B is a specific receptor for C-type natriuretic peptide, having more of a paracrine function in vascular regeneration and endochondral ossification. GC-C mediates the effects of guanylin and uroguanylin on intestinal electrolyte and water transport and on epithelial cell growth and differentiation. GC-E and GC-F are colocalized within the same photoreceptor cells of the retina and have an important role in phototransduction. Finally, the functions of GC-D (located in the olfactory neuroepithelium) and GC-G (expressed in highest amounts in lung, intestine, and skeletal muscle) are completely unknown. This review discusses the structure and functions of membrane GCs, with special emphasis on the physiological endocrine and cardiac functions of GC-A, the regulation of hormone-dependent GC-A activity, and the relevance of alterations of the atrial natriuretic peptide/GC-A system to cardiovascular diseases.},

This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 \% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N(in)-C(in) topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N(out)-C(in) topologies.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Imiquimod 5\% cream (Aldara, Meda Farm, Milan, Italy) is largely used for the treatment of anogenital warts. However, its use during pregnancy is not consolidated with only a small number of patients worldwide that have been treated. The aim of this study is to assess the first line therapeutic efficacy and safety of Imiquimod 5\% cream in pregnant women with external anogenital warts, including extensive condylomata.
STUDY DESIGN: Four pregnant women's with external anogenital warts were treated with Imiquimod 5\% cream, three times a week for four weeks.
RESULTS: Mean number of warts treated per patient was 4.5 (5 SD) and mean area treated was 3.2 cm(2) (1.7 SD). A complete response was observed in two women, while two women had a partial response with a rate of clearing of 70\% and 84\% respectively. No cases of severe adverse local effects were observed in the sites of Imiquimod application. No adverse fetal outcomes or fetal and neonatal abnormalities were observed. No complications were observed in the postpartum and follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Anogenital warts treatment with Imiquimod in pregnancy seems to be promising and not compromise a good pregnancy outcome, in extensive condylomata too. These preliminary data need to be confirmed by larger studies. Similarly, no definitive conclusion may be obtained form a systematic review of the English literature.},

In addition, though many assembly tools are available now, it is unclear whether the existing assemblers perform well enough for all data with different transcriptome complexities. In this paper, we studied these two open problems using two high-performing assemblers, Velvet/Oases and Trinity, on several simulated datasets of human, mouse and S.cerevisiae. The results suggest that (1) the read length of paired reads does not matter once it exceeds a certain threshold, and interestingly, the threshold is distinct in different organisms; (2) the quality of de novo assembly decreases sharply with the increase of transcriptome complexity, all existing de novo assemblers tend to corrupt whenever the genes contain a large number of alternative splicing events.},

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) protects against obesity by promoting energy expenditure via uncoupled respiration. To uncover BAT-specific long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), we used RNA-seq to reconstruct de novo transcriptomes of mouse brown, inguinal white, and epididymal white fat and identified ∼1,500 lncRNAs, including 127 BAT-restricted loci induced during differentiation and often targeted by key regulators PPARγ, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ. One of them, lnc-BATE1, is required for establishment and maintenance of BAT identity and thermogenic capacity. lnc-BATE1 inhibition impairs concurrent activation of brown fat and repression of white fat genes and is partially rescued by exogenous lnc-BATE1 with mutated siRNA-targeting sites, demonstrating a function in trans. We show that lnc-BATE1 binds heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U and that both are required for brown adipogenesis. Our work provides an annotated catalog for the study of fat depot-selective lncRNAs and establishes lnc-BATE1 as a regulator of BAT development and physiology.},

In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.

	isbn = {1520-5010 (Electronic)\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n0893-228X (Linking)},
	abstract = {Metabolic processes have to be regulated tightly to prevent waste of energy and to ensure sufficient detoxification. Most anabolic processes operate in a timely manner when energy intake is the highest, while catabolism takes place in energy spending periods. Endobiotic and xenobiotic metabolism are therefore under circadian control. Circadian regulation is mediated through the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a master autonomous oscillator of the brain. Although many peripheral organs have their own oscillators, the SCN is important in orchestrating and entraining organs according to the environmental light cues. However, light is not the only signal for entrainment of internal clocks. For endobiotic and xenobitoic detoxification pathways, the food composition and intake regime are equally important. The rhythm of the liver as an organ where the major metabolic pathways intersect depends on SCN signals, signals from endocrine tissues, and, importantly, the type and time of feeding or xenobiotics ingestion. Several enzymes are involved in detoxification processes. Phase I is composed mainly of cytochromes P450, which are regulated by nuclear receptors. Phase II enzymes modify the phase I metabolites, while phase III includes membrane transporters responsible for the elimination of modified xenobiotics. Phases I-III of drug metabolism are under strong circadian regulation, starting with the drug-sensing nuclear receptors and ending with drug transporters. Disturbed circadian regualtion (jet-lag, shift work, and dysfunction of core clock genes) leads to changed periods of activity, sleep disorders, disturbed glucose homeostasis, breast or colon cancer, and metabolic syndrome. As many xenobiotics influence the circadian rhythm of the liver, bad drug administration timing can worsen the above listed effects. This review will cover the major hepatic circadian regulation of endogenous and xenobiotic metabolic pathways and will provide examples of how good timing of drug administration can change drug failure to treatment success.},

Analysis of corrected human lymphoblast contact maps provides genome-wide evidence for interchromosomal aggregation of active chromatin marks, including DNase-hypersensitive sites and transcriptionally active foci. We observe extensive long-range (up to 400 kb) cis interactions at active promoters and derive asymmetric contact profiles next to transcription start sites and CTCF binding sites. Clusters of interacting chromosomal domains suggest physical separation of centromere-proximal and centromere-distal regions.

Mammalian Hox genes are targets of Polycomb proteins and form local 3D clusters centered on the H3K27me3 mark. More distal contacts have also been described, yet their selectivity, dynamics, and relation to other layers of chromatin organization remained elusive. We report that repressed Hox genes form mutual intra- and interchromosomal interactions with other genes located in strong domains labeled by H3K27me3. These interactions occur in a central and active nuclear environment that consists of the HiC compartment A, away from peripheral lamina-associated domains. Interactions are independent of nearby H3K27me3-marked loci and determined by chromosomal distance and cell-type-specific scaling factors, thus inducing a moderate reorganization during embryogenesis.

	abstract = {The three-dimensional folding of chromosomes compartmentalizes the genome and and can bring distant functional elements, such as promoters and enhancers, into close spatial proximity (2-6). Deciphering the relationship between chromosome organization and genome activity will aid in understanding genomic processes, like transcription and replication. However, little is known about how chromosomes fold. Microscopy is unable to distinguish large numbers of loci simultaneously or at high resolution. To date, the detection of chromosomal interactions using chromosome conformation capture (3C) and its subsequent adaptations required the choice of a set of target loci, making genome-wide studies impossible (7-10). We developed Hi-C, an extension of 3C that is capable of identifying long range interactions in an unbiased, genome-wide fashion. In Hi-C, cells are fixed with formaldehyde, causing interacting loci to be bound to one another by means of covalent DNA-protein cross-links. When the DNA is subsequently fragmented with a restriction enzyme, these loci remain linked. A biotinylated residue is incorporated as the 5' overhangs are filled in. Next, blunt-end ligation is performed under dilute conditions that favor ligation events between cross-linked DNA fragments. This results in a genome-wide library of ligation products, corresponding to pairs of fragments that were originally in close proximity to each other in the nucleus. Each ligation product is marked with biotin at the site of the junction. The library is sheared, and the junctions are pulled-down with streptavidin beads. The purified junctions can subsequently be analyzed using a high-throughput sequencer, resulting in a catalog of interacting fragments. Direct analysis of the resulting contact matrix reveals numerous features of genomic organization, such as the presence of chromosome territories and the preferential association of small gene-rich chromosomes. Correlation analysis can be applied to the contact matrix, demonstrating that the human genome is segregated into two compartments: a less densely packed compartment containing open, accessible, and active chromatin and a more dense compartment containing closed, inaccessible, and inactive chromatin regions. Finally, ensemble analysis of the contact matrix, coupled with theoretical derivations and computational simulations, revealed that at the megabase scale Hi-C reveals features consistent with a fractal globule conformation.},

Although polysynaptic autonomic neural pathways between the SCN and the liver were observed in rats, whether activation of the sympathetic nervous system entrains clock gene expression in the liver has yet to be understood. To assess sympathetic innervation from the SCN to liver tissue, we investigated whether injection of adrenaline/noradrenaline (epinephrine/norepinephrine) or sympathetic nerve stimulation could induce mPer gene expression in mouse liver. Acute administration of adrenaline or noradrenaline increased mPer1 but not mPer2 expression in the liver of mice in vivo and in hepatic slices in vitro. Electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerves or adrenaline injection caused an elevation of bioluminescence in the liver area of transgenic mice carrying mPer1 promoter-luciferase. Under a light-dark cycle, destruction of the SCN flattened the daily rhythms of not only mPer1, mPer2, and mBmal1 genes but also noradrenaline content in the liver. Daily injection of adrenaline, administered at a fixed time for 6 days, recovered oscillations of mPer2 and mBmal1 gene expression in the liver of mice with SCN lesion on day 7. Sympathetic nerve denervation by 6-hydroxydopamine flattened the daily rhythm of mPer1 and mPer2 gene expression. Thus, on the basis of the present results, activation of the sympathetic nerves through noradrenaline and/or adrenaline release was a factor controlling the peripheral clock.},

RESULTS: We describe the 4DGenome database that stores chromatin interaction data compiled through comprehensive literature curation. The database currently covers both low- and high-throughput assays, including 3C, 4C-Seq, 5C, Hi-C, ChIA-PET and Capture-C. To complement the set of interactions detected by experimental assays, we also include interactions predicted by a recently developed computational method with demonstrated high accuracy. The database currently contains ∼8 million records, covering 102 cell/tissue types in five organisms. Records in the database are described using a standardized file format, facilitating data exchange. The vast major of the interactions were assigned a confidence score. Using the web interface, users can query and download database records via a number of annotation dimensions. Query results can be visualized along with other genomics datasets via links to the UCSC genome browser. We anticipate that 4DGenome will be a valuable resource for investigating the spatial structure-and-function relationship of genomes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: 4Dgenome is freely accessible at http://4dgenome.int-med.uiowa.edu. The database and web interface are implemented in MySQL, Apache and JavaScript with all major browsers supported.

Several 3C variants have been developed (e.g., 4C, 5C, ChIA-PET, Hi-C), allowing large-scale mapping of long-range genomic interactions. Here we describe multiplexed 3C sequencing (3C-seq), a 4C variant coupled to next-generation sequencing, allowing genome-scale detection of long-range interactions with candidate regions. Compared with several other available techniques, 3C-seq offers a superior resolution (typically single restriction fragment resolution; approximately 1-8 kb on average) and can be applied in a semi-high-throughput fashion. It allows the assessment of long-range interactions of up to 192 genes or regions of interest in parallel by multiplexing library sequencing. This renders multiplexed 3C-seq an inexpensive, quick (total hands-on time of 2 weeks) and efficient method that is ideal for the in-depth analysis of complex genetic loci. The preparation of multiplexed 3C-seq libraries can be performed by any investigator with basic skills in molecular biology techniques. Data analysis requires basic expertise in bioinformatics and in Linux and Python environments. The protocol describes all materials, critical steps and bioinformatics tools required for successful application of 3C-seq technology.},

The clock genes mentioned above are expressed not only in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, where the master clock exists, but also in other brain regions and various peripheral tissues. In the liver, clock genes are abundantly expressed and show a clear circa-dian rhythm. Thus, clock genes seem to play a critical role in the molecular clockworks of both the SCN and the liver. Although oscillation of clock genes in the liver is controlled under the circadian clock mechanism in the SCN, we do not know the resetting signals on liver clock function. Over the past few years, use of the pseudorabies virus, a transsynaptic tract tracer, has allowed us to map neural connections between the SCN and peripheral tissues in several physiological systems. Communication between the SCN and peripheral tissues occurs through autonomic nervous systems involving the sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. This review mainly de-scribes both anatomical and physiological experiments to reveal the sym-pathetic control over liver clock function. Although further study is neces-sary to produce the precise mechanism underlying neural control of liver clock systems, evolution of this mechanism will help our understanding of liver clock functions such as drug metabolism and energy metabolism.},

Long-range elements control genes through physical contact with promoters and can be recognized by the presence of specific histone modifications and transcription factor binding.

Here we apply a sequence capture approach to enrich Hi-C libraries for {\textgreater}22,000 annotated mouse promoters to identify statistically significant, long-range interactions at restriction fragment resolution, assigning long-range interacting elements to their target genes genome-wide in embryonic stem cells and fetal liver cells. The distal sites contacting active genes are enriched in active histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy, whereas inactive genes contact distal sites with repressive histone marks, demonstrating the regulatory potential of the distal elements identified. Furthermore, we find that coregulated genes cluster nonrandomly in spatial interaction networks correlated with their biological function and expression level. Interestingly, we find the strongest gene clustering in ES cells between transcription factor genes that control key developmental processes in embryogenesis.

Here we describe the real-time recording of bioluminescence emitted by hepatocytes expressing circadian luciferase reporter genes in freely moving mice. The technology employs a device dubbed RT-Biolumicorder, which consists of a cylindrical cage with reflecting conical walls that channel photons toward a photomultiplier tube. The monitoring of circadian liver gene expression revealed that hepatocyte oscillators of SCN-lesioned mice synchronized more rapidly to feeding cycles than hepatocyte clocks of intact mice. Hence, the SCN uses signaling pathways that counteract those of feeding rhythms when their phase is in conflict with its own phase.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A variety of DNA binding proteins are involved in regulating and shaping the packing of chromatin. They aid the formation of loops in the DNA that function to isolate different structural domains. A recent experimental technique, Hi-C, provides a method for determining the frequency of such looping between all distant parts of the genome. Given that the binding locations of many chromatin associated proteins have also been measured, it has been possible to make estimates for their influence on the long-range interactions as measured by Hi-C. However, a challenge in this analysis is the predominance of non-specific contacts that mask out the specific interactions of interest. RESULTS: We show that transforming the Hi-C contact frequencies into free energies gives a natural method for separating out the distance dependent non-specific interactions. In particular we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the transformed free energy matrix to identify the dominant modes of interaction. PCA identifies systematic effects as well as high frequency spatial noise in the Hi-C data which can be filtered out. Thus it can be used as a data driven approach for normalizing Hi-C data. We assess this PCA based normalization approach, along with several other normalization schemes, by fitting the transformed Hi-C data using a pairwise interaction model that takes as input the known locations of bound chromatin factors. The result of fitting is a set of predictions for the coupling energies between the various chromatin factors and their effect on the energetics of looping. We show that the quality of the fit can be used as a means to determine how much PCA filtering should be applied to the Hi-C data. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the different normalizations of the Hi-C data vary in the quality of fit to the pairwise interaction model. PCA filtering can improve the fit, and the predicted coupling energies lead to biologically meaningful insights for how various chromatin bound factors influence the stability of DNA loops in chromatin.},

Our analysis identified over 5,000 proteins, of which several hundred showed robust diurnal oscillations with peak phases enriched in the morning and during the night and related to core hepatic physiological functions. Combined mathematical modeling of temporal protein and mRNA profiles indicated that proteins accumulate with reduced amplitudes and significant delays, consistent with protein half-life data. Moreover, a group comprising about one-half of the rhythmic proteins showed no corresponding rhythmic mRNAs, indicating significant translational or posttranslational diurnal control. Such rhythms were highly enriched in secreted proteins accumulating tightly during the night. Also, these rhythms persisted in clock-deficient animals subjected to rhythmic feeding, suggesting that food-related entrainment signals influence rhythms in circulating plasma factors.},

	abstract = {Although impressive progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of pacemaker function in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), fundamental questions about cellular and regional heterogeneity within the SCN, and how this heterogeneity might contribute to SCN pacemaker function at a tissue level, have remained unresolved. To reexamine cellular and regional heterogeneity within the SCN, the authors have focused on two key questions: which SCN cells are endogenously rhythmic and/or directly light responsive? Observations of endogenous rhythms of electrical activity, gene/protein expression, and protein phosphorylation suggest that the SCN in mammals examined to date is composed of anatomically distinct rhythmic and nonrhythmic components. Endogenously rhythmic neurons are primarily found in rostral, dorsomedial, and ventromedial portions of the nucleus; at mid and caudal levels, the distribution of endogenously rhythmic cells in the SCN has the appearance of a "shell." The majority of nonrhythmic cells, by contrast, are located in a central "core" region of the SCN, which is complementary to the shell. The location of light-responsive cells, defined by direct retinohypothalamic input and light-induced gene expression, largely overlaps the location of nonrhythmic cells in the SCN core, although, in hamsters and mice light-responsive cells are also present in the ventral portion of the rhythmic shell. While the relative positions of rhythmic and light-responsive components of the SCN are similar between species, the precise boundaries of these components, and neurochemical phenotype of cells within them, are variable. Intercellular communication between these components may be a key feature responsible for the unique pacemaker properties of the SCN observed at a tissue and whole animal level.},

	abstract = {We have analyzed publicly available K562 Hi-C data, which enable genome-wide unbiased capturing of chromatin interactions, using a Mixture Poisson Regression Model and a power-law decay background to define a highly specific set of interacting genomic regions. We integrated multiple ENCODE Consortium resources with the Hi-C data, using DNase-seq data and ChIP-seq data for 45 transcription factors and 9 histone modifications. We classified 12 different sets (clusters) of interacting loci that can be distinguished by their chromatin modifications and which can be categorized into two types of chromatin linkages. The different clusters of loci display very different relationships with transcription factor-binding sites. As expected, many of the transcription factors show binding patterns specific to clusters composed of interacting loci that encompass promoters or enhancers. However, cluster 9, which is distinguished by marks of open chromatin but not by active enhancer or promoter marks, was not bound by most transcription factors but was highly enriched for three transcription factors (GATA1, GATA2 and c-Jun) and three chromatin modifiers (BRG1, INI1 and SIRT6). To investigate the impact of chromatin organization on gene regulation, we performed ribonucleicacid-seq analyses before and after knockdown of GATA1 or GATA2. We found that knockdown of the GATA factors not only alters the expression of genes having a nearby bound GATA but also affects expression of genes in interacting loci. Our work, in combination with previous studies linking regulation by GATA factors with c-Jun and BRG1, provides genome-wide evidence that Hi-C data identify sets of biologically relevant interacting loci.},

Within this framework DNA-DNA contact data are represented as a complex network, for which a broad number of directly applicable methods already exist. In such a network representation, DNA segments and contacts between them are denoted as nodes and edges, respectively. Furthermore, we present a robust method for generating randomized contact networks that explicitly take into account the inherent 3D nature of the genome and serve as realistic null-models for unbiased statistical analyses. By integrating a variety of large-scale genome-wide datasets we demonstrate that meiotic crossover sites display enriched genomic contacts and that cohesin-bound genes are significantly colocalized in the yeast nucleus. We anticipate that the complex network framework in conjunction with the randomization of DNA-DNA contact networks will become a widely used tool in the study of nuclear architecture.},

A conserved transcriptional-translational autoregulatory loop generates molecular oscillations of 'clock genes' at the cellular level. In mammals, the circadian system is organized in a hierarchical manner, in which a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) regulates downstream oscillators in peripheral tissues. Recent findings have revealed that the clock is cell-autonomous and self-sustained not only in a central pacemaker, the SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and in dissociated cultured cells. It is becoming evident that specific contribution of each clock component and interactions among the components vary in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we review the general mechanisms of the circadian clockwork, describe recent findings that elucidate tissue-specific expression patterns of the clock genes and address the importance of circadian regulation in peripheral tissues for an organism's overall well-being.},

Because of this long-range action, the annotation of enhancer element-target promoter pairs remains elusive. Here, we developed a novel analysis methodology that takes advantage of Hi-C data to comprehensively identify these interactions throughout the human genome. To do this, we used a geometric distribution-based model to identify DNA-DNA interaction hotspots that contact gene promoters with high confidence. We observed that these promoter-interacting hotspots significantly overlap with known enhancer-associated histone modifications and DNase I hypersensitive sites. Thus, we defined thousands of candidate enhancer elements by incorporating these features, and found that they have a significant propensity to be bound by p300, an enhancer binding transcription factor. Furthermore, we revealed that their target genes are significantly bound by RNA Polymerase II and demonstrate tissue-specific expression. Finally, we uncovered that these elements are generally found within 1 Mb of their targets, and often regulate multiple genes. In total, our study presents a novel high-throughput workflow for confident, genome-wide discovery of enhancer-target promoter pairs, which will significantly improve our understanding of these regulatory interactions.},

Distal QTLs are enriched within topologically associated domains and exhibit largely concordant variation of chromatin state coordinated by proximal and distal non-coding genetic variants.

	abstract = {Circadian and sleep-homeostatic processes both contribute to sleep timing and sleep structure. Elimination of circadian rhythms through lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the master circadian pacemaker, leads to fragmentation of wakefulness and sleep but does not eliminate the homeostatic response to sleep loss as indexed by the increase in EEG delta power. In humans, EEG delta power declines during sleep episodes nearly independently of circadian phase. Such observations have contributed to the prevailing notion that circadian and homeostatic processes are separate but recent data imply that this segregation may not extend to the molecular level. Here we summarize the criteria and evidence for a role for clock genes in sleep homeostasis. Studies in mice with targeted disruption for core circadian clock genes have revealed alterations in circadian rhythmicity as well as changes in sleep duration, sleep structure and EEG delta power. Clock-gene expression in brain areas outside the SCN, in particular the cerebral cortex, depends to a large extent on prior sleep-wake history. Evidence for effects of clock genes on sleep homeostasis has also been obtained in Drosophila and humans, pointing to a phylogenetically preserved pathway. These findings suggest that, while within the SCN clock genes are utilized to set internal time-of-day, in the forebrain the same feedback circuitry may be utilized to track time spent awake and asleep. The mechanisms by which clock-gene expression is coupled to the sleep-wake distribution could be through cellular energy charge whereby clock genes act as energy sensors. The data underscore the interrelationships between energy metabolism, circadian rhythmicity, and sleep regulation.},

These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.},

Here we perform genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and RNA-seq to obtain comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) maps of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and to dissect X chromosome dosage compensation, which balances gene expression between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. The dosage compensation complex (DCC), a condensin complex, binds to both hermaphrodite X chromosomes via sequence-specific recruitment elements on X (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. Most DCC condensin subunits also act in other condensin complexes to control the compaction and resolution of all mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. By comparing chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos, we show that the DCC remodels hermaphrodite X chromosomes into a sex-specific spatial conformation distinct from autosomes. Dosage-compensated X chromosomes consist of self-interacting domains (∼1 Mb) resembling mammalian topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs on X chromosomes have stronger boundaries and more regular spacing than on autosomes. Many TAD boundaries on X chromosomes coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites and become diminished or lost in DCC-defective mutants, thereby converting the topology of X to a conformation resembling autosomes. rex sites engage in DCC-dependent long-range interactions, with the most frequent interactions occurring between rex sites at DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. These results imply that the DCC reshapes the topology of X chromosomes by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing weak boundaries through interactions between its highest-affinity binding sites. As this model predicts, deletion of an endogenous rex site at a DCC-dependent TAD boundary using CRISPR/Cas9 greatly diminished the boundary. Thus, the DCC imposes a distinct higher-order structure onto X chromosomes while regulating gene expression chromosome-wide.},

Although the suprachiasmatic clock is not shifted by mealtime under light-dark conditions, nutritional cues can feedback onto it and modulate its function under hypo- and hypercaloric (high-fat) conditions. Food-related reward cues are other modulators of the master clock. Circadian disturbances (e.g., desynchronization induced by shift work or chronic jet lag) are frequently associated with metabolic dysfunctions (chronobesity) and vice versa. Pharmacological tools and natural synchronizers (i.e., light and mealtime) can be useful as chronotherapeutic treatments to limit the occurrence of metabolic risk factors. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {We describe a method, Hi-C, to comprehensively detect chromatin interactions in the mammalian nucleus. This method is based on Chromosome Conformation Capture, in which chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde, then digested, and re-ligated in such a way that only DNA fragments that are covalently linked together form ligation products. The ligation products contain the information of not only where they originated from in the genomic sequence but also where they reside, physically, in the 3D organization of the genome. In Hi-C, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction, enabling selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions followed by deep sequencing. The compatibility of Hi-C with next generation sequencing platforms makes it possible to detect chromatin interactions on an unprecedented scale. This advance gives Hi-C the power to both explore the biophysical properties of chromatin as well as the implications of chromatin structure for the biological functions of the nucleus. A massively parallel survey of chromatin interaction provides the previously missing dimension of spatial context to other genomic studies. This spatial context will provide a new perspective to studies of chromatin and its role in genome regulation in normal conditions and in disease.},

A master clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) synchronizes internal time with the external light-dark cycle, thus entraining the overall rhythmicity of the organism. Recent findings have challenged the dominant role of the SCN in physiological regulation and it becomes increasingly evident that close interaction between different central and peripheral clocks is necessary to maintain robust circadian rhythms of physiology and metabolism. In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding circadian organization in the SCN and in other central and peripheral tissues. We outline the communication pathways between different tissue clocks and, exemplified by the regulation of glucocorticoid release from the adrenal gland and glucose homeostasis in the blood, characterize the interaction between different clocks in the regulation of physiological processes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between chromatin interactions and gene co-expression. However, predicting gene co-expression from frequent long-range chromatin interactions remains challenging. We address this by characterizing the topology of the cortical chromatin interaction network using scale-aware topological measures. We demonstrate that based on these characterizations it is possible to accurately predict spatial co-expression between genes in the mouse cortex. Consistent with previous findings, we find that the chromatin interaction profile of a gene-pair is a good predictor of their spatial co-expression. However, the accuracy of the prediction can be substantially improved when chromatin interactions are described using scale-aware topological measures of the multi-resolution chromatin interaction network. We conclude that, for co-expression prediction, it is necessary to take into account different levels of chromatin interactions ranging from direct interaction between genes (i.e. small-scale) to chromatin compartment interactions (i.e. large-scale).},

However, the mechanism by which Xist RNA "paints" the Xi has long remained elusive. Here, we show that a matrix protein hnRNP U/SP120/SAF-A is required for the accumulation of Xist RNA on the Xi. Xist RNA and hnRNP U interact and upon depletion of hnRNP U, Xist RNA is detached from the Xi and diffusely localized into the nucleoplasm. In addition, ES cells lacking hnRNP U expression fail to form the Xi. We propose that the association with matrix proteins is an essential step in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by Xist RNA.},

	abstract = {Mammals have two principal types of fat. White adipose tissue primarily serves to store extra energy as triglycerides, whereas brown adipose tissue is specialized to burn lipids for heat generation and energy expenditure as a defence against cold and obesity. Recent studies have demonstrated that brown adipocytes arise in vivo from a Myf5-positive, myoblastic progenitor by the action of Prdm16 (PR domain containing 16). Here, we identified a brown-fat-enriched miRNA cluster, MiR-193b-365, as a key regulator of brown fat development. Blocking miR-193b and/or miR-365 in primary brown preadipocytes markedly impaired brown adipocyte adipogenesis by enhancing Runx1t1 (runt-related transcription factor 1; translocated to, 1) expression, whereas myogenic markers were significantly induced. Forced expression of Mir193b and/or Mir365 in C2C12 myoblasts blocked the entire programme of myogenesis, and, in adipogenic conditions, miR-193b induced myoblasts to differentiate into brown adipocytes. Mir193b-365 was upregulated by Prdm16 partially through Pparα. Our results demonstrate that Mir193b-365 serves as an essential regulator for brown fat differentiation, in part by repressing myogenesis.},

A new computer program called TBA (for "threaded blockset aligner") builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that all matching segments occur in the same order and orientation in the given sequences; inversions and duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto any genome chosen as a reference, thus guaranteeing that different projections present consistent predictions of which genomic positions are orthologous. This capability is illustrated using a new visualization tool to view TBA-generated alignments of vertebrate Hox clusters from both the mammalian and fish perspectives. Experimental evaluation of alignment quality, using a program that simulates evolutionary change in genomic sequences, indicates that TBA is more accurate than earlier programs. To perform the dynamic-programming alignment step, TBA runs a stand-alone program called MULTIZ, which can be used to align highly rearranged or incompletely sequenced genomes. We describe our use of MULTIZ to produce the whole-genome multiple alignments at the Santa Cruz Genome Browser.},

However, the methyltransferases responsible for H3K4me1/2 on enhancers remain elusive. Furthermore, how these enzymes function on enhancers to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression is unclear. In this study, we identify MLL4 (KMT2D) as a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase with partial functional redundancy with MLL3 (KMT2C). Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model systems, we show that MLL4 exhibits cell-type- and differentiation-stage-specific genomic binding and is predominantly localized on enhancers. MLL4 co-localizes with lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) on active enhancers during differentiation. Deletion of Mll4 markedly decreases H3K4me1/2, H3K27ac, Mediator and Polymerase II levels on enhancers and leads to severe defects in cell-type-specific gene expression and cell differentiation. Together, these findings identify MLL4 as a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase essential for enhancer activation during cell differentiation.

TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved.

RESULTS: We show that PhyloCSF's classification performance in 12-species Drosophila genome alignments exceeds all other methods we compared in a previous study. We anticipate that this method will be widely applicable as the transcriptomes of many additional species, tissues and subcellular compartments are sequenced, particularly in the context of ENCODE and modENCODE, and as interest grows in long non-coding RNAs, often initially recognized by their lack of protein coding potential rather than conserved RNA secondary structures.

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.
Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is considered to be one of the master regulators of adipocyte differentiation. The presence of two functionally distinct types of adipose tissue, white and brown (WAT and BAT), requires an even more complex regulation of adipose tissue development. In this review we will focus on the role of PPARγ coregulators in adipogenesis and especially on the role of PPARγ coregulators in white and brown adipose tissue. Specificity in coregulator function in WAT and BAT may form an additional level of regulation of adipose tissue development.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are thought to influence the structure of hnRNA and participate in the processing of hnRNA to mRNA. The hnRNP U protein is an abundant nucleoplasmic phosphoprotein that is the largest of the major hnRNP proteins (120 kDa by SDS-PAGE). HnRNP U binds pre-mRNA in vivo and binds both RNA and ssDNA in vitro. Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the hnRNP U protein, the determination of its amino acid sequence and the delineation of a region in this protein that confers RNA binding. The predicted amino acid sequence of hnRNP U contains 806 amino acids (88,939 Daltons), and shows no extensive homology to any known proteins. The N-terminus is rich in acidic residues and the C-terminus is glycine-rich. In addition, a glutamine-rich stretch, a putative NTP binding site and a putative nuclear localization signal are present. It could not be defined from the sequence what segment of the protein confers its RNA binding activity. We identified an RNA binding activity within the C-terminal glycine-rich 112 amino acids. This region, designated U protein glycine-rich RNA binding region (U-gly), can by itself bind RNA. Furthermore, fusion of U-gly to a heterologous bacterial protein (maltose binding protein) converts this fusion protein into an RNA binding protein. A 26 amino acid peptide within U-gly is necessary for the RNA binding activity of the U protein. Interestingly, this peptide contains a cluster of RGG repeats with characteristic spacing and this motif is found also in several other RNA binding proteins. We have termed this region the RGG box and propose that it is an RNA binding motif and a predictor of RNA binding activity.},

But making a rodent without a specific gene is a chore—so much so that doctoral students sometimes dedicate their entire PhD work to generating a single mouse strain. The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC), launched in 2006, plans to change all that. The consortium, involving scientists from 33 research centers in nine countries, is creating a library of every gene knockout in embryonic stem cell lines, which can be used to produce mouse strains. In June, the group passed 10,000 embryonic stem cell lines generated in a targeted fashion, and, as they approach their goal of around 21,000 mouse gene knockouts, the project is moving onto its next step: phenotypes. The offshoot collaboration, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), plans to document diseaserelated phenotypes for each generated mouse strain including metabolic, neurological and behavioral data. The effort received support on 29 September, when the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded \$110 million to three US centers over five years to phenotype 833 strains each. Hannah Waters spoke with Steve Brown, chairman of the IMPC and director of the UK Medical Research Council's Mammalian Genetics Unit in Harwell to learn more about the plans for the project.},

The EuroPhenome interface allows the user to access the data via the phenotype or genotype. It also allows the user to access the data in a variety of ways, including graphical display, statistical analysis and access to the raw data via web services. The raw phenotyping data captured in EuroPhenome is annotated by an annotation pipeline which automatically identifies statistically different mutants from the appropriate baseline and assigns ontology terms for that specific test. Mutant phenotypes can be quickly identified using two EuroPhenome tools: PhenoMap, a graphical representation of statistically relevant phenotypes, and mining for a mutant using ontology terms. To assist with data definition and cross-database comparisons, phenotype data is annotated using combinations of terms from biological ontologies.},

Quality control (QC) is critical to ensure that RNA-seq data are of high quality and suitable for subsequent analyses. However, QC is a time-consuming and complex task, due to the massive size and versatile nature of RNA-seq data. Therefore, a convenient and comprehensive QC tool to assess RNA-seq quality is sorely needed.
RESULTS: We developed the RSeQC package to comprehensively evaluate different aspects of RNA-seq experiments, such as sequence quality, GC bias, polymerase chain reaction bias, nucleotide composition bias, sequencing depth, strand specificity, coverage uniformity and read distribution over the genome structure. RSeQC takes both SAM and BAM files as input, which can be produced by most RNA-seq mapping tools as well as BED files, which are widely used for gene models. Most modules in RSeQC take advantage of R scripts for visualization, and they are notably efficient in dealing with large BAM/SAM files containing hundreds of millions of alignments.

By analyzing four libraries (brain, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum), we redefined more accurately the TSPs of 11-27\% of the analyzed transcriptional units that were hit. The frequency of CAGE tags correlates well with results from other analyses, such as serial analysis of gene expression, and furthermore maps the TSPs more accurately, including in tissue-specific cases.

The Ebf DNA-binding motif was highly enriched within brown adipose-specific Pparγ binding sites that we identified by genome-wide ChIP-Seq. Of the Ebf isoforms, Ebf2 was selectively expressed in brown relative to white adipocytes and was bound at brown adipose-specific Pparγ target genes. When expressed in myoblasts or white preadipose cells, Ebf2 recruited Pparγ to its brown-selective binding sites and reprogrammed cells to a brown fat fate. Brown adipose cells and tissue from Ebf2-deficient mice displayed a loss of brown-specific characteristics and thermogenic capacity.

However, the functional significance of these transcripts has been particularly controversial. Although there are some well-characterized examples, most ({\textgreater}95\%) show little evidence of evolutionary conservation and have been suggested to represent transcriptional noise,. Here we report a new approach to identifying large non-coding RNAs using chromatin-state maps to discover discrete transcriptional units intervening known protein-coding loci. Our approach identified {\textasciitilde}1,600 large multi-exonic RNAs across four mouse cell types. In sharp contrast to previous collections, these large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) show strong purifying selection in their genomic loci, exonic sequences and promoter regions, with greater than 95\% showing clear evolutionary conservation. We also developed a functional genomics approach that assigns putative functions to each lincRNA, demonstrating a diverse range of roles for lincRNAs in processes from embryonic stem cell pluripotency to cell proliferation. We obtained independent functional validation for the predictions for over 100 lincRNAs, using cell-based assays. In particular, we demonstrate that specific lincRNAs are transcriptionally regulated by key transcription factors in these processes such as p53, NFκB, Sox2, Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Nanog. Together, these results define a unique collection of functional lincRNAs that are highly conserved and implicated in diverse biological processes.},

In this work, we focus on a comprehensive comparison of seven recently proposed normalization methods for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data, with an emphasis on the use of varied real and simulated datasets involving different species and experimental designs to represent data characteristics commonly observed in practice.

These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.},

Although brown fat was once considered only necessary in babies, recent morphological and imaging studies have provided evidence that, contrary to prior belief, this tissue is present and active in adult humans. In recent years, the topic of brown adipose tissue has been reinvigorated with many new studies regarding brown adipose tissue differentiation, function and therapeutic promise.

	volume = {6},
	issn = {1755-8794},
	doi = {10.1186/1755-8794-6-21},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing is critical for generating complex proteomes in response to extracellular signals. Nuclear receptors including estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and their ligands promote alternative splicing. The endogenous targets of ERα:estradiol (E2)-mediated alternative splicing and the influence of extracellular kinases that phosphorylate ERα on E2-induced splicing are unknown.
METHODS: MCF-7 and its anti-estrogen derivatives were used for the majority of the assays. CD44 mini gene was used to measure the effect of E2 and AKT on alternative splicing. ExonHit array analysis was performed to identify E2 and AKT-regulated endogenous alternatively spliced apoptosis-related genes. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to verify alternative splicing. ERα binding to alternatively spliced genes was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation-ELISA and Annexin V labeling assays were done to measure cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively.
RESULTS: We identified the targets of E2-induced alternative splicing and deconstructed some of the mechanisms surrounding E2-induced splicing by combining splice array with ERα cistrome and gene expression array. E2-induced alternatively spliced genes fall into at least two subgroups: coupled to E2-regulated transcription and ERα binding to the gene without an effect on rate of transcription. Further, AKT, which phosphorylates both ERα and splicing factors, influenced ERα:E2 dependent splicing in a gene-specific manner. Genes that are alternatively spliced include FAS/CD95, FGFR2, and AXIN-1. E2 increased the expression of FGFR2 C1 isoform but reduced C3 isoform at mRNA level. E2-induced alternative splicing of FAS and FGFR2 in MCF-7 cells correlated with resistance to FAS activation-induced apoptosis and response to keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), respectively. Resistance of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen was associated with ERα-dependent overexpression of FGFR2, whereas resistance to fulvestrant was associated with ERα-dependent isoform switching, which correlated with altered response to KGF.
CONCLUSION: E2 may partly alter cellular proteome through alternative splicing uncoupled to its effects on transcription initiation and aberration in E2-induced alternative splicing events may influence response to anti-estrogens.},

For temporal analysis, mice were gavaged every 24 h for 3 days with 100 microg/kg EE or vehicle and liver samples were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 72 h. Gene expression was monitored using custom cDNA microarrays containing 3067 genes/ESTs of which 393 exhibited a change at one or more time points. Functional gene annotation extracted from public databases associated temporal gene expression changes with growth and proliferation, cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix responses, microtubule-based processes, oxidative metabolism and stress, and lipid metabolism and transport. In the dose-response study, hepatic samples were collected 24 h following treatment with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 or 250 microg/kg EE. Thirty-nine of the 79 genes identified as differentially regulated at 24 h in the time course study exhibited a dose-response relationship with an average ED50 value of 47 +/- 3.5 microg/kg. Comparative analysis indicated that many of the identified temporal and dose-dependent hepatic responses are similar to EE-induced uterine responses reported in the literature and in a companion study using the same animals. Results from these studies confirm that the liver is a highly estrogen responsive tissue that exhibits a number of common responses shared with the uterus as well as distinct estrogen-mediated profiles. These data will further aid in the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of estrogens in the liver as well as in other classical and non-classical estrogen responsive tissues.},

	abstract = {Background. A number of algorithms exist for analysing RNA-sequencing data to infer profiles of differential gene expression. Problems inherent in building algorithms around statistical models of over dispersed count data are formidable and frequently lead to non-uniform p-value distributions for null-hypothesis data and to inaccurate estimates of false discovery rates (FDRs). This can lead to an inaccurate measure of significance and loss of power to detect differential expression. Results. We use synthetic and real biological data to assess the ability of several available R packages to accurately estimate FDRs. The packages surveyed are based on statistical models of overdispersed Poisson data and include edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2, PoissonSeq and QuasiSeq. Also tested is an add-on package to edgeR and DESeq which we introduce called Polyfit. Polyfit aims to address the problem of a non-uniform null p-value distribution for two-class datasets by adapting the Storey-Tibshirani procedure. Conclusions. We find the best performing package in the sense that it achieves a low FDR which is accurately estimated over the full range of p-values, albeit with a very slow run time, is the QLSpline implementation of QuasiSeq. This finding holds provided the number of biological replicates in each condition is at least 4. The next best performing packages are edgeR and DESeq2. When the number of biological replicates is sufficiently high, and within a range accessible to multiplexed experimental designs, the Polyfit extension improves the performance DESeq (for approximately 6 or more replicates per condition), making its performance comparable with that of edgeR and DESeq2 in our tests with synthetic data.},

New technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, have dramatically reduced sequencing costs, to a level where metagenomic analysis may become a viable alternative to more-focused assessments of the phylogenetic (e.g., 16S rRNA genes) and functional diversity of microbial communities. To determine whether the short (approximately 100 to 200 bp) sequence reads obtained from pyrosequencing are appropriate for the phylogenetic and functional characterization of microbial communities, the results of BLAST and COG analyses were compared for long (approximately 750 bp) and randomly derived short reads from each of two microbial and one virioplankton metagenome libraries. Overall, BLASTX searches against the GenBank nr database found far fewer homologs within the short-sequence libraries. This was especially pronounced for a Chesapeake Bay virioplankton metagenome library. Increasing the short-read sampling depth or the length of derived short reads (up to 400 bp) did not completely resolve the discrepancy in BLASTX homolog detection. Only in cases where the long-read sequence had a close homolog (low BLAST E-score) did the derived short-read sequence also find a significant homolog. Thus, more-distant homologs of microbial and viral genes are not detected by short-read sequences. Among COG hits, derived short reads sampled at a depth of two short reads per long read missed up to 72\% of the COG hits found using long reads. Noting the current limitation in computational approaches for the analysis of short sequences, the use of short-read-length libraries does not appear to be an appropriate tool for the metagenomic characterization of microbial communities.},

	abstract = {The cyclin D1 gene is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancer and is capable of inducing mammary tumorigenesis when overexpressed in transgenic mice. The BRCA1 breast tumor susceptibility gene product inhibits breast cancer cellular growth and the activity of several transcription factors. Herein, cyclin D1 antagonized BRCA1-mediated repression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-dependent gene expression. Cyclin D1 repression of BRCA1 function was mediated independently of its cyclin-dependent kinase, retinoblastoma protein, or p160 (SRC-1) functions in human breast and prostate cancer cells. In vitro, cyclin D1 competed with BRCA1 for ERalpha binding. Cyclin D1 and BRCA1 were both capable of binding ERalpha in a common region of the ERalpha hinge domain. A novel domain of cyclin D1, predicted to form a helix-loop-helix structure, was required for binding to ERalpha and for rescue of BRCA1-mediated ERalpha transcriptional repression. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, 17beta-estradiol (E2) enhanced ERalpha and cyclin D1 recruitment to an estrogen response element (ERE). Cyclin D1 expression enhanced ERalpha recruitment to an ERE. E2 reduced BRCA1 recruitment and BRCA1 expression inhibited E2-induced ERalpha recruitment at 12 hours. Cyclin D1 expression antagonized BRCA1 inhibition of ERalpha recruitment to an ERE, providing a mechanism by which cyclin D1 antagonizes BRCA1 function at an ERE. As cyclin D1 abundance is regulated by oncogenic and mitogenic signals, the antagonism of the BRCA1-mediated ERalpha repression by cyclin D1 may contribute to the selective induction of BRCA1-regulated target genes.},

Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.

Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and {\textasciitilde}1 h of hands-on time.},

The cross-platform concordance in terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or enriched pathways is linearly correlated with treatment effect size (R(2)0.8). Furthermore, the concordance is also affected by transcript abundance and biological complexity of the MOA. RNA-seq outperforms microarray (93\% versus 75\%) in DEG verification as assessed by quantitative PCR, with the gain mainly due to its improved accuracy for low-abundance transcripts.

	abstract = {Cyclin-dependent kinases trigger and coordinate transitions between different phases the cell division cycle (CDK1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7). They also play a role in apoptosis (CDK2), in neuronal cells (CDK5) and in the control of transcription (CDK 7, 8, 9). Intensive screening has lead to the recent identification of a series of chemical inhibitors of CDKs: olomoucine, roscovitine, purvalanol, CVT-313, flavopiridol, g-butyrolactone, indirubins, paullones and staurosporine. Some of these compounds display remarkable selectivities and efficiencies (IC50 {\textless} 25 nM). Many have been co-crystallised with CDK2 and their interactions with the kinase have been analysed in atomic detail. These inhibitors all act by competing with ATP for binding at the catalytic site. Most inhibitors present a flat heterocyclic ring system that occupies the purine binding pocket as well as form 2 or 3 hydrogen bonds with Glu-81 and Leu-83. The binding modes of these inhibitors are reviewed in this article. Knowledge of the CDK/inhibitor interactions will be of great help to design inhibitors with improved selectivity our potency as well as to generate affinity chromatography matrices for the purification and identification of their cellular targets. The potential use of CDK inhibitors is being extensively evaluated in cancer chemotherapy and other fields such as the cardiovascular domain (restenosis), dermatology (psoriasis), nephrology (glomerulonephritis) parasitology (unicellular parasites such as Plasmodium, Trypanosomes, Toxoplasm,.etc.), neurology (Alzheimer's disease) and viral infections (cytomegalovirus, H.I.V., herpes).},

	abstract = {The genomic organization of the CDK2 gene, which overlaps the melanocyte-specific gene SILV/PMEL17, poses an interesting regulatory challenge. We show that, despite its ubiquitous expression, CDK2 exhibits tissue-specific regulation by the essential melanocyte lineage transcription factor MITF. In addition, functional studies revealed this regulation to be critical for maintaining CDK2 kinase activity and growth of melanoma cells. Expression levels of MITF and CDK2 are tightly correlated in primary melanoma specimens and predict susceptibility to the CDK2 inhibitor roscovitine. CDK2 depletion suppressed growth and cell cycle progression in melanoma, but not other cancers, corroborating previous results. Collectively, these data indicate that CDK2 activity in melanoma is largely maintained at the transcriptional level by MITF, and unlike other malignancies, it may be a suitable drug target in melanoma.},

	abstract = {Background: Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and their cyclin regulatory subunits control cell growth and division. Cdk2/cyclin E complexes are thought to be required because they phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein and drive cells through the G1/S transition into the S phase of the cell cycle. In addition, Cdk2 associates with cyclin A, which itself is essential for cell proliferation during early embryonic development.

Results: In order to study the functions of Cdk2 in vivo, we generated Cdk2 knockout mice. Surprisingly, these mice are viable, and therefore Cdk2 is not an essential gene in the mouse. However, Cdk2 is required for germ cell development; both male and female Cdk2−/− mice are sterile. Immunoprecipitates of cyclin E1 complexes from Cdk2−/− spleen extracts displayed no activity toward histone H1. Cyclin A2 complexes were active in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), embryo extracts and in spleen extracts from young animals. In contrast, there was little cyclin A2 kinase activity in immortalized MEFs and spleen extracts from adult animals. Cdk2−/− MEFs proliferate but enter delayed into S phase. Ectopic expression of Cdk2 in Cdk2−/− MEFs rescued the delayed entry into S phase.

Conclusions: Although Cdk2 is not an essential gene in the mouse, it is required for germ cell development and meiosis. Loss of Cdk2 affects the timing of S phase, suggesting that Cdk2 is involved in regulating progression through the mitotic cell cycle.},

Optimum binding occurs with a moderately sized aliphatic O(6) substituent that packs tightly against the hydrophobic patch presented by the glycine loop, centered on Val18, an interaction promoted by the conformational restraints imposed in a cyclohexylmethyl or cyclohexenylmethyl ring. Structure-based design generated (R)-(2-amino-9H-purin-6-yloxymethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one (56), which reproduces the reported hydrogen bonds formed between ATP and Asp86 and Gln131 but failed to improve inhibitory potency.

	abstract = {A novel and robust automated docking method that predicts the bound conformations of flexible ligands to macromolecular targets has been developed and tested, in combination with a new scoring function that estimates the free energy change upon binding. Interestingly, this method applies a Lamarckian model of genetics, in which environmental adaptations of an individual's phenotype are reverse transcribed into its genotype and become heritable traits (sic). We consider three search methods, Monte Carlo simulated annealing, a traditional genetic algorithm, and the Lamarckian genetic algorithm, and compare their performance in dockings of seven protein–ligand test systems having known three-dimensional structure. We show that both the traditional and Lamarckian genetic algorithms can handle ligands with more degrees of freedom than the simulated annealing method used in earlier versions of AUTODOCK, and that the Lamarckian genetic algorithm is the most efficient, reliable, and successful of the three. The empirical free energy function was calibrated using a set of 30 structurally known protein–ligand complexes with experimentally determined binding constants. Linear regression analysis of the observed binding constants in terms of a wide variety of structure-derived molecular properties was performed. The final model had a residual standard error of 9.11 kJ mol−1 (2.177 kcal mol−1) and was chosen as the new energy function.

Therefore, rather than reviewing the field of virtual screening for kinases, we attempt here a hybrid approach of presenting what is known and common practice together with new studies on CDK2 and SRC kinase. To illustrate the challenges and pitfalls of virtual screening for kinase targets we focus on the question of how ranking is influenced by the database screened, the docking scheme, the scoring function, the activity of the compounds used for testing, and small changes in the binding pocket. In addition, a case study of finding irreversible inhibitors of ErbB2 through in silico screening is presented.},

Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95\% of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.},

However in the giant silkmoth, Antheraea pernyi, per expression and that of the partner gene, tim, is not consistent with the negative feedback role. As an initial step in developing an alternative dipteran model to Drosophila, we have identified the per orthologue in the housefly, Musca domestica. The Musca per sequence highlights a pattern of conservation and divergence similar to other insect per genes. The PAS dimerization domain shows an unexpected phylogenetic relationship in comparison with the corresponding region of other Drosophila species, and this appears to correlate with a functional assay of the Musca per transgene in Drosophila melanogaster per-mutant hosts. A simple hypothesis based on the coevolution of the PERIOD and TIMELESS proteins with respect to the PER PAS domain can explain the behavioral data gathered from transformants.},

	abstract = {A genetic screen for mutants that alter circadian rhythms in Drosophila identified the first clock gene-the period (per) gene. The per gene is a central player within a transcriptional feedback loop that represents the core mechanism for keeping circadian time in Drosophila and other animals. The per feedback loop, or core loop, is interlocked with the Clock (Clk) feedback loop, but whether the Clk feedback loop contributes to circadian timekeeping is not known. A series of distinct molecular events are thought to control transcriptional feedback in the core loop. The time it takes to complete these events should take much less than 24h, thus delays must be imposed at different steps within the core loop. As new clock genes are identified, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these delays have been revealed in ever-increasing detail and provide an in-depth accounting of how transcriptional feedback loops keep circadian time. The phase of these feedback loops shifts to maintain synchrony with environmental cycles, the most reliable of which is light. Although a great deal is known about cell-autonomous mechanisms of light-induced phase shifting by CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), much less is known about non-cell autonomous mechanisms. CRY mediates phase shifts through an uncharacterized mechanism in certain brain oscillator neurons and carries out a dual role as a photoreceptor and transcription factor in other tissues. Here, I review how transcriptional feedback loops function to keep time in Drosophila, how they impose delays to maintain a 24-h cycle, and how they maintain synchrony with environmental light:dark cycles. The transcriptional feedback loops that keep time in Drosophila are well conserved in other animals, thus what we learn about these loops in Drosophila should continue to provide insight into the operation of analogous transcriptional feedback loops in other animals.},

Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

These tests are particularly important for moving beyond "just so" stories when discussing the evolution of clock phenotypes, and we provide relevant circadian examples. We also focus on methods that can be used to study genetic variation, such as quantitative trait loci analysis. We discuss the various bootstrapping or resampling techniques that can be applied to generate confidence intervals in the various methodologies and then examine the use of interspecific transformation studies, which can, and have, provide some useful insights, not only into clock gene evolution in particular, but "behavioral" gene evolution in general.

The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method.

The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

We define a loop as a segment of chain whose end residues are in contact. We find some loops which are threaded by another segment of chain passing through the loop or actually linked with another loop. Fifty-six loop threadings were found among the 20 proteins studied, all of them occurring in a subset of seven proteins. In our sample, threadings and linkings were generally found if and only if the protein has more than 200 residues. To account for the existence of these topological features, despite their apparent entropic unfavorability, we have proposed a number of kinetic mechanisms by which they may form without a thread actually passing through a loop. We have found that almost all loop threadings possess structural features that would make one of these mechanisms plausible.},

The revision of several protein models to correct errors has prompted the development of new criteria for judging the validity of X-ray and NMR structures, as well as the formation of energetic and empirical methods to evaluate the correctness of protein models. The challenge is to distinguish between a mistraced or wrongly folded model, and one that is basically correct, but not adequately refined. We show that an effective test of the accuracy of a 3D protein model is a comparison of the model to its own amino-acid sequence, using a 3D profile, computed from the atomic coordinates of the structure 3D profiles of correct protein structures match their own sequences with high scores. In contrast, 3D profiles for protein models known to be wrong score poorly. An incorrectly modelled segment in an otherwise correct structure can be identified by examining the profile score in a moving-window scan. The accuracy of a protein model can be assessed by its 3D profile, regardless of whether the model has been derived by X-ray, NMR or computational procedures.},

However, in the recent past several experimentally determined protein structures have been proven to contain major errors, indicating that in some cases the interpretation of experimental data is difficult and may yield incorrect models. Such problems can be avoided when computational methods are employed which complement experimental structure determinations. A prerequisite of such computational tools is that they are independent of the parameters obtained from a particular experiment. In addition such techniques are able to support and accelerate experimental structure determinations. Here we present techniques based on knowledge based mean fields which can be used to judge the quality of protein folds. The methods can be used to identify misfolded structures as well as faulty parts of structural models. The techniques are even applicable in cases where only the C alpha trace of a protein conformation is available.

The ProSA program (Protein Structure Analysis) is an established tool which has a large user base and is frequently employed in the refinement and validation of experimental protein structures and in structure prediction and modeling. The analysis of protein structures is generally a difficult and cumbersome exercise. The new service presented here is a straightforward and easy to use extension of the classic ProSA program which exploits the advantages of interactive web-based applications for the display of scores and energy plots that highlight potential problems spotted in protein structures. In particular, the quality scores of a protein are displayed in the context of all known protein structures and problematic parts of a structure are shown and highlighted in a 3D molecule viewer. The service specifically addresses the needs encountered in the validation of protein structures obtained from X-ray analysis, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

	abstract = {The solution structure, backbone dynamics and rotational diffusion of the Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c2have been determined using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. In all, 1204 NOE-derived distances were used in the structure calculation to give a final ensemble with 0.59(±0.08) Å rms deviation for the backbone atoms (C, Cαand N) with respect to the mean coordinates. There is no major difference between the solution structure and the previously solved X-ray crystal structure (1.07(±0.07) Å rms difference for the backbone atoms), although certain significant local structural differences have been identified. This protein contains five helical regions and a histidine-heme binding domain, connected by a series of structured loops. The orientation of the helices provides an excellent sampling of angular space and thus allows a precise characterization of the anisotropic diffusion tensor. Analysis of the hydrodynamics of the protein has been performed by interpretation of the15N relaxation data using isotropic, axially asymmetric and fully anisotropic diffusion tensors. The protein can be shown to exhibit significant anisotropic reorientation with a diffusion tensor with principal axes values of 1.405(±0.031)×107 s−1, 1.566(±0.051)×107 s−1and 1.829(±0.054)×107 s−1. Hydrodynamic calculations performed on the solution structure predict values of 1.399×107 s−1, 1.500×107 s−1and 1.863×107 s−1when a solvent shell of 3.5 Å is included in the calculation. The optimal orientation of the diffusion tensor has been incorporated into a hybrid Lipari-Szabo type local motion-anisotropic rotational diffusion model to characterize the local mobility in the molecule. The mobility parameters thus extracted show a quantitative improvement with respect to the model-free analysis assuming isotropic reorientation; helical regions exhibit similar dynamic properties and fewer residues require more complex models of internal motion. While the molecule is essentially rigid, a tripeptide loop region (residues 101 to 103) exhibits flexibility in the range of 20 to 30 ps, which appears to be correlated with the order in the NMR solution structure.},

	abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described. Curr. Protoc.

	abstract = {Parasitic diseases have a devastating, long-term impact on human health, welfare and food production worldwide. More than two billion people are infected with geohelminths, including the roundworms Ascaris (common roundworm), Necator and Ancylostoma (hookworms), and Trichuris (whipworm), mainly in developing or impoverished nations of Asia, Africa and Latin America. In humans, the diseases caused by these parasites result in about 135,000 deaths annually, with a global burden comparable with that of malaria or tuberculosis in disability-adjusted life years. Ascaris alone infects around 1.2 billion people and, in children, causes nutritional deficiency, impaired physical and cognitive development and, in severe cases, death. Ascaris also causes major production losses in pigs owing to reduced growth, failure to thrive and mortality. The Ascaris-swine model makes it possible to study the parasite, its relationship with the host, and ascariasis at the molecular level. To enable such molecular studies, we report the 273 megabase draft genome of Ascaris suum and compare it with other nematode genomes. This genome has low repeat content (4.4\%) and encodes about 18,500 protein-coding genes. Notably, the A. suum secretome (about 750 molecules) is rich in peptidases linked to the penetration and degradation of host tissues, and an assemblage of molecules likely to modulate or evade host immune responses. This genome provides a comprehensive resource to the scientific community and underpins the development of new and urgently needed interventions (drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests) against ascariasis and other nematodiases.},

	doi = {10.3389/fnmol.2014.00017},
	abstract = {Atrial natriuretic factor receptor guanylate cyclase (ANF-RGC), was the first discovered member of the mammalian membrane guanylate cyclase family. The hallmark feature of the family is that a single protein contains both the site for recognition of the regulatory signal and the ability to transduce it into the production of the second messenger, cyclic GMP. For over two decades, the family has been classified into two subfamilies, the hormone receptor subfamily with ANF-RGC being its paramount member, and the Ca(2+) modulated subfamily, which includes the rod outer segment guanylate cyclases, ROS-GC1 and 2, and the olfactory neuroepithelial guanylate cyclase. ANF-RGC is the receptor and the signal transducer of the most hypotensive hormones, ANF- and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). After binding these hormones at the extracellular domain it, at its intracellular domain, signals activation of the C-terminal catalytic module and accelerates the production of cyclic GMP. Cyclic GMP then serves the second messenger role in biological responses of ANF and BNP such as natriuresis, diuresis, vasorelaxation, and anti-proliferation. Very recently another modus operandus for ANF-RGC was revealed. Its crux is that ANF-RGC activity is also regulated by Ca(2+). The Ca(2+) sensor neurocalcin d mediates this signaling mechanism. Strikingly, the Ca(2+) and ANF signaling mechanisms employ separate structural motifs of ANF-RGC in modulating its core catalytic domain in accelerating the production of cyclic GMP. In this review the biochemistry and physiology of these mechanisms with emphasis on cardiovascular regulation will be discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mammalian genomes consist of regions differing in GC content, referred to as isochores or GC-content domains. The scientific debate is still open as to whether such compositional heterogeneity is a selected or neutral trait.
RESULTS: Here we analyze SNP allele frequencies, retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs), as well as fixed substitutions accumulated in the human lineage since its divergence from chimpanzee to indicate that biased gene conversion (BGC) has been playing a role in within-genome GC content variation. Yet, a distinct contribution to GC content evolution is accounted for by a selective process. Accordingly, we searched for independent evidences that GC content distribution does not conform to neutral expectations. Indeed, after correcting for possible biases, we show that intron GC content and size display isochore-specific correlations.
CONCLUSION: We consider that the more parsimonious explanation for our results is that GC content is subjected to the action of both weak selection and BGC in the human genome with features such as nucleosome positioning or chromatin conformation possibly representing the final target of selective processes. This view might reconcile previous contrasting findings and add some theoretical background to recent evidences suggesting that GC content domains display different behaviors with respect to highly regulated biological processes such as developmentally-stage related gene expression and programmed replication timing during neural stem cell differentiation.},

	doi = {10.3389/fimmu.2014.00316},
	abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) belong to the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) family, a key component of the innate immune system. TLRs detect invading pathogens and initiate an immediate immune response to them, followed by a long-lasting adaptive immune response. Activation of TLRs leads to the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules. TLR4 specifically recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide, along with several other components of pathogens and endogenous molecules produced during abnormal situations, such as tissue damage. Evolution across species can lead to substantial diversity in the TLR4's affinity and specificity to its ligands, the TLR4 gene and cellular expression patterns and tissue distribution. Consequently, TLR4 functions vary across different species. In recent years, the use of synthetic TLR agonists as adjuvants has emerged as a realistic therapeutic goal, notably for the development of vaccines against poorly immunogenic targets. Given that an adjuvanted vaccine must be assessed in pre-clinical animal models before being tested in humans, the extent to which an animal model represents and predicts the human condition is of particular importance. This review focuses on the current knowledge on the critical points of divergence between human and the mammalian species commonly used in vaccine research and development (non-human primate, mouse, rat, rabbit, swine, and dog), in terms of molecular, cellular, and functional properties of TLR4.},

Yet the focus of PANTHER has continually shifted toward more accurate and detailed representations of evolutionary events in gene family histories. The trees are now designed to represent gene family evolution, including inference of evolutionary events, such as speciation and gene duplication. Subfamilies are still curated and used to define HMMs, but gene ontology functional annotations can now be made at any node in the tree, and are designed to represent gain and loss of function by ancestral genes during evolution. Finally, PANTHER now includes stable database identifiers for inferred ancestral genes, which are used to associate inferred gene attributes with particular genes in the common ancestral genomes of extant species.},

In Rhodobacter (Rba.) sphaeroides, the subunit PufX is involved in the dimeric organization of the core complex. Here, we report the 3D reconstruction at 12 Å by cryoelectron microscopy of the core complex of Rba. veldkampii, a complex of ∼300 kDa without symmetry. The core complex is monomeric and constituted by a light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1) ring surrounding a uniquely oriented reaction center (RC). The LH1 consists of 15 resolved α/β heterodimers and is interrupted. Within the opening, PufX polypeptide is assigned at a position facing the QB site of the RC. This core complex is different from a dissociated dimer of the core complex of Rba. sphaeroides revealing that PufX in Rba. veldkampii is unable to dimerize. The absence in PufX of Rba. veldkampii of a G31XXXG35 dimerization motif highlights the transmembrane interactions between PufX subunits involved in the dimerization of the core complexes of Rhodobacter species.},

The genes for LH-II alpha and beta subunits only have one transcript, 0.5 kilobase (kb) long, whereas the genes for LH-I have two transcripts (0.5 and 2.6 kb). The small transcript (0.5 kb) is the mRNA only for LH-I beta and alpha polypeptides, whereas the large transcript (2.6 kb) codes for RC-L, RC-M, and the beta and alpha polypeptides of LH-I, as well as the product of an unknown open reading frame designated ORF C2397. These five genes thus comprise a single operon (designated the puf operon). The mRNA specifying the LH-II polypeptides is more abundant, more sensitive to changes in O2 concentration, and shows a variation over a wider range than that of the mRNA for LH-I, indicating that the genes for LH-II and LH-I/RC are regulated independently. The gene for RC-H (puhA) has at least two transcripts (1.2 and 1.4 kb) that initiate within ORF F1696 and respond differentially to light intensity. The expression of the genes coding for RC-L, RC-M, and RC-H is coordinately regulated by light intensity and O2 concentration. An increase in light intensity causes a decrease in the expression of the genes for LH-I, LH-II, and RC proteins. The genes coding for the enzymes in the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathways are regulated by light intensity and O2 in a manner similar to that of the genes for LH and RC proteins. The crt genes coding for the enzymes in carotenoid biosynthetic pathways, however, are regulated in an opposite fashion: high light intensity results in increased expression of crt genes. These results are interpreted based on the protective function of carotenoids under high light intensity in the presence of O2.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an extremely useful tool for molecular and evolutionary biology and there are several programs and algorithms available for this purpose. Although previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each program's algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of execution.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that mostly the consistency-based programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT outperformed the other programs in accuracy. Whenever sequences with large N/C terminal extensions were present in the BAliBASE suite, Probalign, MAFFT and also CLUSTAL OMEGA outperformed Probcons and T-Coffee. The drawback of these programs is that they are more memory-greedy and slower than POA, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN-TX, and MUSCLE. CLUSTALW and MUSCLE were the fastest programs, being CLUSTALW the least RAM memory demanding program.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results presented herein, all four programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT are well recommended for better accuracy of multiple sequence alignments. T-Coffee and recent versions of MAFFT can deliver faster and reliable alignments, which are specially suited for larger datasets than those encountered in the BAliBASE suite, if multi-core computers are available. In fact, parallelization of alignments for multi-core computers should probably be addressed by more programs in a near future, which will certainly improve performance significantly.},

The sequences are assumed a priori to share a common ancestor, and the trees are constructed from difference matrices derived directly from the multiple alignment. The thrust of the method involves putting more trust in the comparison of recently diverged sequences than in those evolved in the distant past. In particular, this rule is followed: "once a gap, always a gap." The method has been applied to three sets of protein sequences: 7 superoxide dismutases, 11 globins, and 9 tyrosine kinase-like sequences. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees for these sets of sequences were determined and compared with trees derived by conventional pairwise treatments. In several instances, the progressive method led to trees that appeared to be more in line with biological expectations than were trees obtained by more commonly used methods.},

	abstract = {In purple photosynthetic bacteria the initial steps of light energy transduction take place in an RC-LH1 complex formed by the photochemical reaction centre (RC) and the LH1 light harvesting pigment-protein. In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the RC-LH1 complex assembles in a dimeric form in which two RCs are surrounded by an S-shaped LH1 antenna. There is currently debate over the detailed architecture of this dimeric RC-LH1 complex, with particular emphasis on the location and precise function of a minor polypeptide component termed PufX. It has been hypothesised that the membrane-spanning helical region of PufX contains a GxxxG dimerisation motif that facilitates the formation of a dimer of PufX at the interface of the RC-LH1 dimer, and more specifically that the formation of this PufX dimer seeds assembly of the remaining RC-LH1 dimer (J. Busselez et al., 2007). In the present work this hypothesis was tested by site directed mutagenesis of the glycine residues proposed to form the GxxxG motif. Mutation of these glycines to leucine did not decrease the propensity of the RC-LH1 complex to assemble in a dimeric form, as would be expected from experimental studies of the effect of mutation on GxxxG motifs in other membrane proteins. Indeed increased yields of dimer were seen in two of the glycine-to-leucine mutants constructed. It is concluded that the PufX from Rhodobacter sphaeroides does not contain a genuine GxxxG helix dimerisation motif.},

We have determined the solution structure of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides PufX using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The PufX, functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, forms a stable alpha helix consisting of 21 residues over the central transmembrane domain. The overall structure of the PufX is very similar to those of the LH1 alpha- and beta-polypeptides from Rhodospirillum rubrum and LH2 polypeptides. A short segment (Lys28-Gly35) rich in Gly and Ala residues revealed a relatively fast exchange between the backbone amide protons and deuteriums in the hydroxyl groups of the solvent, indicating that the backbone of this segment is more easily accessible to the surrounding solvent molecules compared to those of its neighboring portions. The Gly- and Ala-rich segment is located in the middle of the central helix and forms an extensive groove-like conformation on the surface with the neighboring residues, where the residues with large side chains are aligned on one side of the helix, and small residues are aligned on the other face. Such a structural motif may serve as a functional site responsible for ubiquinol transport from the core complex to the membrane phase and for sequence-specific helix-helix interactions with the neighboring polypeptides.},

However, no eradication of infection has been achieved so far with any drug. Further, a residual immune dysregulation associated to chronic immune activation and incomplete restoration of B and T cell subsets, together with HIV DNA persistence in reservoirs, are still unmet needs of the highly active antiretroviral therapy, causing novel "non-AIDS related" diseases that account for a higher risk of death even in virologically suppressed patients. These "ART unmet needs" represent a problem, which is expected to increase by ART roll out. Further, in countries such as South Africa, where six millions of individuals are infected, ART appears unable to contain the epidemics. Regretfully, all the attempts at developing a preventative vaccine have been largely disappointing. However, recent therapeutic immunization strategies have opened new avenues for HIV treatment, which might be exploitable also for preventative vaccine approaches. For example, immunization strategies aimed at targeting key viral products responsible of virus transmission, activation, and maintenance of virus reservoirs may intensify drug efficacy and lead to a functional cure providing new perspectives also for prevention and future virus eradication strategies. However, this approach imposes new challenges to the scientific community, vaccine developers, and regulatory bodies, such as the identification of novel immunological and virological biomarkers to assess efficacy end-points, taking advantage from the natural history of infection and exploiting lessons from former trials. This review will focus first on recent advancement of therapeutic strategies, then on the progresses made in preventative approaches, discussing concepts, and problems for the way ahead for the development of vaccines for HIV treatment and prevention.},

Recent annotation changes include reporting supporting evidence for transcript records, modification of exon feature annotation and the addition of a structured report of gene and sequence attributes of biological interest.

However, to experimentally investigate every gene's function, the research community requires a high-quality annotation of alternative splicing, pseudogenes, and promoter regions that can only be provided by manual intervention. Manual curation of the human genome will be a long-term project as experimental data are continually produced to confirm or refine the predictions, and new features such as noncoding RNAs and enhancers have not been fully identified. Such a highly curated human gene-set made publicly available will be a great asset for the experimental community and for future comparative genome projects.},

For each positive enhancer, we provide digital images of whole-mount embryo staining at embryonic day 11.5 and an anatomical description of the reporter gene expression pattern. Users can retrieve elements near single genes of interest, search for enhancers that target reporter gene expression to a particular tissue, or download entire collections of enhancers with a defined tissue specificity or conservation depth. These experimentally validated training sets are expected to provide a basis for a wide range of downstream computational and functional studies of enhancer function.},

Genes and phenotypes are described in separate entries and are given unique, stable six-digit identifiers (MIM numbers). OMIM entries have a structured free-text format that provides the flexibility necessary to describe the complex and nuanced relationships between genes and genetic phenotypes in an efficient manner. OMIM also has a derivative table of genes and genetic phenotypes, the Morbid Map. OMIM.org has enhanced search capabilities such as genome coordinate searching and thesaurus-enhanced search term options. Phenotypic series have been created to facilitate viewing genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes. Clinical synopsis features are enhanced with UMLS, Human Phenotype Ontology and Elements of Morphology terms and image links. All OMIM data are available for FTP download and through an API.

Several studies have demonstrated that regulatory modules are under positive selection and, therefore, are often conserved between related species. Using this evolutionary principle, we have created a comparative tool, rVISTA, for analyzing the regulatory potential of noncoding sequences. Our ability to experimentally identify functional noncoding sequences is extremely limited, therefore, rVISTA attempts to fill this great gap in genomic analysis by offering a powerful approach for eliminating TFBSs least likely to be biologically relevant. The rVISTA tool combines TFBS predictions, sequence comparisons and cluster analysis to identify noncoding DNA regions that are evolutionarily conserved and present in a specific configuration within genomic sequences. Here, we present the newly developed version 2.0 of the rVISTA tool, which can process alignments generated by both the zPicture and blastz alignment programs or use pre-computed pairwise alignments of several vertebrate genomes available from the ECR Browser and GALA database. The rVISTA web server is closely interconnected with the TRANSFAC database, allowing users to either search for matrices present in the TRANSFAC library collection or search for user-defined consensus sequences.

Most, perhaps all, CGIs are sites of transcription initiation, including thousands that are remote from currently annotated promoters. Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Silencing of CGI promoters is achieved through dense CpG methylation or polycomb recruitment, again using their distinctive DNA sequence composition. CGIs are therefore generically equipped to influence local chromatin structure and simplify regulation of gene activity.},

We identify {\textasciitilde}19,000 diGly-modified lysine residues within {\textasciitilde}5000 proteins. Using quantitative proteomics we monitored temporal changes in diGly site abundance in response to both proteasomal and translational inhibition, indicating both a dependence on ongoing translation to observe alterations in site abundance and distinct dynamics of individual modified lysines in response to proteasome inhibition. Further, we demonstrate that quantitative diGly proteomics can be utilized to identify substrates for cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. Interrogation of the ubiquitinome allows for not only a quantitative assessment of alterations in protein homeostasis fidelity, but also identification of substrates for individual ubiquitin pathway enzymes.},

Together, these approaches yielded many known CRL substrates as well as a multitude of previously unknown putative substrates. We demonstrate that one substrate, NUSAP1, is an SCF(Cyclin F) substrate during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is also degraded in response to DNA damage. This collection of regulated substrates is highly enriched for nodes in protein interaction networks, representing critical connections between regulatory pathways.

We identified 195 SNPs in 16 genes/regions associated with 3 major lipid fractions and 2 apolipoprotein components at p{\textless}10(-5), with the associations being broadly concordant with prior genome-wide analysis. SNPs associated with LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were located in LDLR, PCSK9, APOB, CELSR2, HMGCR, CETP, the TOMM40-APOE-C1-C2-C4 cluster, and the APOA5-A4-C3-A1 cluster; SNPs associated with HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI were in CETP, LPL, LIPC, APOA5-A4-C3-A1, and ABCA1; and SNPs associated with triglycerides in GCKR, BAZ1B, MLXIPL, LPL, and APOA5-A4-C3-A1. For 48 SNPs in previously unreported loci that were significant at p{\textless}10(-4) in Whitehall II, in silico analysis including the British Women's Heart and Health Study, BRIGHT, ASCOT, and NORDIL studies (total n{\textgreater}12,500) revealed previously unreported associations of SH2B3 (p{\textless}2.2x10(-6)), BMPR2 (p{\textless}2.3x10(-7)), BCL3/PVRL2 (flanking APOE; p{\textless}4.4x10(-8)), and SMARCA4 (flanking LDLR; p{\textless}2.5x10(-7)) with LDL cholesterol. Common alleles in these genes explained 6.1\%-14.7\% of the variance in the five lipid-related traits, and individuals at opposite tails of the additive allele score exhibited substantial differences in trait levels (e.g., {\textgreater}1 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol [approximately 1 SD of the trait distribution]). These data suggest that multiple common alleles of small effect can make important contributions to individual differences in blood lipids potentially relevant to the assessment of CVD risk.

We determined the entire sequence of 21,243 selected clones and found that 14,490 cDNAs (10,897 clusters) were unique to the FLJ collection. About half of them (5,416) seemed to be protein-coding. Of those, 1,999 clusters had not been predicted by computational methods. The distribution of GC content of nonpredicted cDNAs had a peak at approximately 58\% compared with a peak at approximately 42\%for predicted cDNAs. Thus, there seems to be a slight bias against GC-rich transcripts in current gene prediction procedures. The rest of the cDNAs unique to the FLJ collection (5,481) contained no obvious open reading frames (ORFs) and thus are candidate noncoding RNAs. About one-fourth of them (1,378) showed a clear pattern of splicing. The distribution of GC content of noncoding cDNAs was narrow and had a peak at approximately 42\%, relatively low compared with that of protein-coding cDNAs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Thiazolidinediones are used to treat type 2 diabetes. Their use has been associated with peripheral edema and congestive heart failure-outcomes that may have a genetic etiology.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 4,197 participants of the multiethnic DREAM (Diabetes REduction Assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medication) trial with a 50k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array, which captures ∼2000 cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic genes. We tested 32,088 SNPs for an association with edema among Europeans who received rosiglitazone (n = 965).
RESULTS: One SNP, rs6123045, in NFATC2 was significantly associated with edema (odds ratio 1.89 [95\% CI 1.47-2.42]; P = 5.32 × 10(-7), corrected P = 0.017). Homozygous individuals had the highest edema rate (hazard ratio 2.89, P = 4.22 × 10(-4)) when compared with individuals homozygous for the protective allele, with heterozygous individuals having an intermediate risk. The interaction between the SNP and rosiglitazone for edema was significant (P = 7.68 × 10(-3)). Six SNPs in NFATC2 were significant in both Europeans and Latin Americans (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation at the NFATC2 locus contributes to edema among individuals who receive rosiglitazone.},

	abstract = {Body fat distribution, particularly centralized obesity, is associated with metabolic risk above and beyond total adiposity. We performed genome-wide association of abdominal adipose depots quantified using computed tomography (CT) to uncover novel loci for body fat distribution among participants of European ancestry. Subcutaneous and visceral fat were quantified in 5,560 women and 4,997 men from 4 population-based studies. Genome-wide genotyping was performed using standard arrays and imputed to {\textasciitilde}2.5 million Hapmap SNPs. Each study performed a genome-wide association analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), VAT adjusted for body mass index, and VAT/SAT ratio (a metric of the propensity to store fat viscerally as compared to subcutaneously) in the overall sample and in women and men separately. A weighted z-score meta-analysis was conducted. For the VAT/SAT ratio, our most significant p-value was rs11118316 at LYPLAL1 gene (p = 3.1 × 10E-09), previously identified in association with waist-hip ratio. For SAT, the most significant SNP was in the FTO gene (p = 5.9 × 10E-08). Given the known gender differences in body fat distribution, we performed sex-specific analyses. Our most significant finding was for VAT in women, rs1659258 near THNSL2 (p = 1.6 × 10-08), but not men (p = 0.75). Validation of this SNP in the GIANT consortium data demonstrated a similar sex-specific pattern, with observed significance in women (p = 0.006) but not men (p = 0.24) for BMI and waist circumference (p = 0.04 [women], p = 0.49 [men]). Finally, we interrogated our data for the 14 recently published loci for body fat distribution (measured by waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI); associations were observed at 7 of these loci. In contrast, we observed associations at only 7/32 loci previously identified in association with BMI; the majority of overlap was observed with SAT. Genome-wide association for visceral and subcutaneous fat revealed a SNP for VAT in women. More refined phenotypes for body composition and fat distribution can detect new loci not previously uncovered in large-scale GWAS of anthropometric traits.},

RanBP16 and its close human homologue, RanBP17, are distant members of the importin beta family.

The presence of an importin-beta N-terminal domain at their N-terminus, their size of approximately 110 kD, their nuclear localization and the identity of the homologue to a gene of a recently submitted RanGTP binding protein (RanBP16), suggest that its protein is a novel member of the importin-beta superfamily of nuclear transport receptors, therefore called RanBP17. Northern blot analysis of human tissues revealed a ubiquitous expression pattern of the RanBP16 gene and a very restricted expression pattern of the RanBP17 gene, showing high expression in testis and pancreas. Both genes are evolutionary conserved and show a high (99 and 94\%) amino acid conservation with their murine counterparts and a striking similarity (40\%) to a protein product of Caenorhabditis elegans (C35A5.8).},

Yeast two-hybrid, mammalian two-hybrid, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate specific interaction of E12 with RANBP17, a novel member of the importin-beta superfamily; this interaction maps to the CRM1 homology region of RANBP17. Ectopic expression of RANBP17 leads to a approximately 3-fold increase in E2A/MyoD mediated transactivation of an E-box regulated luciferase reporter gene. Interaction and transactivation studies also revealed similar functions for RANBP16/XPO7. Furthermore, ectopic expression of either RANBP16 or RANBP17 resulted in increased level of endogenous transcript for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(Waf1/Cip1), a well-characterized E2A target gene.

Driven by the Human Genome Project, these technologies are now maturing and robust strategies are found in both SNP discovery and genotyping areas. The nearly completed human genome sequence provides the reference against which all other sequencing data can be compared. Global SNP discovery is therefore only limited by the amount of funding available for the activity. Local, target, SNP discovery relies mostly on direct DNA sequencing or on denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). The number of SNP genotyping methods has exploded in recent years and many robust methods are currently available. The demand for SNP genotyping is great, however, and no one method is able to meet the needs of all studies using SNPs.

	abstract = {Genital warts affect at least 1\% of sexually active adults. Current therapies are inadequate because they are often painful, may fail to prevent recurrence and transmission of warts, and usually require either surgery or at least application by a physician. Investigation of immunotherapy for genital warts began with interferon. It has been studied in topical, intralesional, systemic and adjuvant applications. We review the major clinical trials of interferon for genital warts, and conclude that intralesional therapy with interferon-alpha or interferon-beta, with complete response rates of 36 to 63\%, is the most successful route for interferon monotherapy. In choosing patients for therapy with interferon, major considerations include immune status, pregnancy and ability to return for frequent injections. Imiquimod is a new immune response enhancer that acts through stimulating host cytokine production. Interleukins-1, -2, -6, -8 and -12, interferons alpha, beta and gamma and tumour necrosis factor alpha have all been associated with the mechanism of action of imiquimod. Recently, 3 clinical trials have reported positive results using topical imiquimod to treat genital warts. Complete response rates ranged from 37 to 54\% for these controlled trials of 5\% imiquimod cream. Adverse effects reported include localised pruritus, erythema, erosion, burning and pain, which were rarely severe enough to cause discontinuation of the medication. Although further trials are necessary to identify the role of imiquimod in the therapy of genital warts, it appears to be an efficacious and well tolerated patient-controlled measure for wart therapy.},

Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 activation by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and TLR7/8 activation by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) expressed by viruses and/or released from necrotic cells initiates a pro-inflammatory immune response; however it is unknown whether viral/endogenous RNA is a key initiating signal that contributes to the development of PE. We hypothesized that TLR3/7/8 activation will be evident in placentas of women with PE, and sufficient to induce PE-like symptoms in mice. Placental immunoreactivity and mRNA levels of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 were increased significantly in women with PE compared to normotensive women. Treatment of human trophoblasts with the TLR3 agonist polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), the TLR7-specific agonist imiquimod (R-837), or the TLR7/8 agonist CLO97 significantly increased TLR3/7/8 levels. Treatment of mice with poly I:C, R-837, or CLO97 caused pregnancy-dependent hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, splenomegaly, and placental inflammation. These data demonstrate that RNA-mediated activation of TLR3 and TLR7/8 plays a key role in the development of PE.},

In addition to proteins consistent with traditionally accepted roles in lipid transport, HDL carries surprising constituents, such as members of the complement pathway, protease inhibitors involved in hemostasis, acute-phase response proteins, immune function mediators, and even metal-binding proteins. This compositional diversity fits well with hundreds of studies demonstrating a wide functional pleiotrophy, including roles in lipid transport, oxidation, inflammation, hemostasis, and immunity. This review summarizes the progression of our understanding of HDL proteomic complexity and points out key experimental observations that reinforce the functional diversity of HDL. The possibility of specific HDL subspecies with distinct functions, the evidence supporting this concept, and some of the best examples of experimentally defined HDL subspecies are also discussed. Finally, key challenges facing the field are highlighted, particularly the need to identify and define the function of HDL subspecies to better inform attempts to pharmacologically manipulate HDL for the benefit of cardiovascular disease and possibly other maladies.},

Endothelial dysfunction represents the ultimate link between atherosclerotic risk factors that promote atherosclerosis. HDL-C is thought to exert at least some parts of its antiatherogenic facilities via stimulating endothelial NO production, nearby inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation. HDL-C is capable of opposing LDL's inductive effects and avoiding the ox-LDL's inhibition of eNOS. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an HDL-associated enzyme esterase which appears to contribute to the antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic capabilities of HDL-C. "Healthy HDL," namely the particle that contains the active Paraoxonase 1, has the power to suppress the formation of oxidized lipids. "Dysfunctional HDL," on the contrary, has reduced Paraoxonase 1 enzyme activity and not only fails in its mission but also potentially leads to greater formation of oxidized lipids/lipoproteins to cause endothelial dysfunction. The association of HDL-C PON1 and endothelial dysfunction depends largely on the molecules with exact damaging effect on NO synthase coupling. Loss of nitric oxide bioavailability has a pivotal role in endothelial dysfunction preceding the appearance of atherosclerosis. Analyses of HDL-C and Paraoxonase1 would be more important in the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis in the very near future.},

We tested whether relative levels of proteins in HDL(2) could be used as biomarkers for coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: Twenty control and eighteen CAD subjects matched for HDL-cholesterol, age, and sex were studied. HDL(2) isolated from plasma was digested with trypsin and analyzed by high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and pattern recognition analysis.
RESULTS: Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of mass spectra clearly differentiated CAD from control subjects with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC(AUC)) of 0.94. Targeted tandem mass spectrometric analysis of the model's significant features revealed that HDL(2) of CAD subjects contained oxidized methionine residues of apolipoprotein A-I and elevated levels of apolipoprotein C-III. A proteomic signature composed of MALDI-MS signals from apoA-I, apoC-III, Lp(a) and apoC-I accurately classified CAD and control subjects (ROC(AUC)=0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: HDL(2) of CAD subjects carries a distinct protein cargo and that protein oxidation helps generate dysfunctional HDL. Moreover, models based on selected identified peptides in MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the HDL may have diagnostic potential.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
High plasma HDL cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction, but whether this association is causal is unclear. Exploiting the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis, are independent of non-genetic confounding, and are unmodified by disease processes, mendelian randomisation can be used to test the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal.
Methods
We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First, we used as an instrument a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPG Asn396Ser) and tested this SNP in 20 studies (20 913 myocardial infarction cases, 95 407 controls). Second, we used as an instrument a genetic score consisting of 14 common SNPs that exclusively associate with HDL cholesterol and tested this score in up to 12 482 cases of myocardial infarction and 41 331 controls. As a positive control, we also tested a genetic score of 13 common SNPs exclusively associated with LDL cholesterol.
Findings
Carriers of the LIPG 396Ser allele (2·6\% frequency) had higher HDL cholesterol (0·14 mmol/L higher, p=8×10−13) but similar levels of other lipid and non-lipid risk factors for myocardial infarction compared with non-carriers. This difference in HDL cholesterol is expected to decrease risk of myocardial infarction by 13\% (odds ratio [OR] 0·87, 95\% CI 0·84–0·91). However, we noted that the 396Ser allele was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0·99, 95\% CI 0·88–1·11, p=0·85). From observational epidemiology, an increase of 1 SD in HDL cholesterol was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0·62, 95\% CI 0·58–0·66). However, a 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0·93, 95\% CI 0·68–1·26, p=0·63). For LDL cholesterol, the estimate from observational epidemiology (a 1 SD increase in LDL cholesterol associated with OR 1·54, 95\% CI 1·45–1·63) was concordant with that from genetic score (OR 2·13, 95\% CI 1·69–2·69, p=2×10−10).
Interpretation
Some genetic mechanisms that raise plasma HDL cholesterol do not seem to lower risk of myocardial infarction. These data challenge the concept that raising of plasma HDL cholesterol will uniformly translate into reductions in risk of myocardial infarction.

Recently, high concentrations of HDL or apolipoprotein (apo) A-I in individuals with diabetes or coronary heart disease were found to reveal dysfunction in some population-based studies. Such dysfunction of HDL and its apos A-I, A-II, and C-III has been observed in a general population for the first time among Turkish adults. Functional defectiveness manifested itself by unexpected correlations with inflammatory biomarkers and, in long-term follow-up, by lack of protection against diabetes and coronary heart disease, accounting for the excess incidences in Turks. Female sex was more pronouncedly affected by this process that presumably exists in other ethnicities in South Asia, East Europe, and the Middle East. In contradistinction, in Western and East Asian population, only individuals with glucose intolerance or those at risk for cardiometabolic disease are considered to be or were documented in a review of clinical trials to have been affected by impaired function of HDL. High-density lipoprotein dysfunctionality is closely linked to obesity and low-grade inflammation yet seems to act partly independently of them. Cigarette smoking in overweight women with low-grade inflammation appears to offer limited protection against cardiometabolic risk. The great impact in public health of the dysfunction of protective serum proteins requires individual clinical recognition, appropriate preventive measures, and delineation of management, including with anti-inflammatory drugs.},

A representative sample of 3035 middle-aged Turkish adults free of CHD at baseline was studied with this purpose prospectively over a mean of 7.8 years. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were found to be correlated in women positively with plasma fibrinogen and weakly with waist girth and C-reactive protein, and to be not correlated with fasting insulin. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol protected men against future CHD risk (for a 12-mg/dL increment: relative risk = 0.80 [95\% confidence interval, 0.69-0.95]) after multivariable adjustment in logistic regression analyses for age, smoking status, physical activity grade, hypertension, abdominal obesity, diabetes, and lipid-lowering drugs. However, men were not protected against risk of diabetes. In women, HDL cholesterol was not associated with risk for CHD, whereas intermediate (40-60 mg/dL) compared with lower HDL cholesterol levels proved protective against risk of diabetes (relative risk = 0.57 [95\% confidence interval, 0.36-0.90]) after adjustments that included apolipoprotein A-I tertiles. Yet higher serum concentrations failed to yield protection against diabetes. It was concluded that HDL particles confer partially lacking protection against cardiometabolic risk among Turks, and this impairment is modulated by sex. This highly important observation may result from a setting of prevailing chronic subclinical inflammation.},

These findings, together with the termination of the niacin-based AIM-HIGH trial and the discontinuation of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor dalcetrapib, challenge the concept that raising of plasma HDL-C will uniformly translate into reductions in CVD risk. HDL particles exhibit several anti-atherosclerotic properties, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities and cellular cholesterol efflux activity. Furthermore, HDL particles are very heterogeneous in terms of size, structure, composition and metabolism. HDL functionality may be associated more strongly with CVD risk than the traditional HDL-C levels.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postprandially induced oxidative stress can cause damage to mitochondrial components and initiate cellular degradative processes; which are related to obesity comorbidities.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This trial sought to determine whether weight loss induced by caloric restriction provides antioxidant protection to reduce the postprandial response of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress markers.
METHODS: A group of overweight/obese volunteers (n = 17; 39 +/-7 years, 32.5 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2)) followed an 8-week hypocaloric diet. Volunteers provided blood samples at fasting and 2-h after a test drink (CHO: 95\% E, PROT: 5\% E and containing antioxidants) and these were examined for postprandial oxidative stress responses, before and after the nutritional intervention. The expression of four mitochondrial-related genes, COX15, NDUFS2, MGST2 and TNF-alfa, was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by quantitative RT-PCR. Lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress biomarkers, total antioxidant capacity (AOP), uric acid and glutathione peroxidase were also determined.
RESULTS: Before nutritional treatment, the test drink induced a postprandial increase in lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress biomarkers with a concomitant increase in the AOP. The increase in postprandial oxidative stress biomarkers was accompanied by a decrease in PBMC COX15 mRNA levels. Interestingly, after the weight loss period (-5.8 +/- 2.3\%), the postprandial-induced changes were lower than at the beginning of the study and involved oxidative stress biomarkers and the COX15 and MGST2 transcripts. This finding suggests the occurrence of a tachyphylactic process.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that the well-known effect of energy restriction on oxidative stress is accompanied by a tolerance mechanism on the postprandial oxidative stress response and mitochondrial function-related genes. Indeed, the COX15 and MGST2 gene expression assays in PBMC emerged as valuable nutrigenomic biomarkers of the oxidative response under energy-restriction conditions.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare the feasibility and effectiveness of intermittent continuous energy (IER) with continuous energy restriction (CER) for weight loss, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic disease risk markers.
DESIGN: Randomized comparison of a 25\% energy restriction as IER (∼ 2710 kJ/day for 2 days/week) or CER (∼ 6276 kJ/day for 7 days/week) in 107 overweight or obese (mean (± s.d.) body mass index 30.6 (± 5.1) kg m(-2)) premenopausal women observed over a period of 6 months. Weight, anthropometry, biomarkers for breast cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dementia risk; insulin resistance (HOMA), oxidative stress markers, leptin, adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF binding proteins 1 and 2, androgens, prolactin, inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein and sialic acid), lipids, blood pressure and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were assessed at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months.
RESULTS: Last observation carried forward analysis showed that IER and CER are equally effective for weight loss: mean (95\% confidence interval ) weight change for IER was -6.4 (-7.9 to -4.8) kg vs -5.6 (-6.9 to -4.4) kg for CER (P-value for difference between groups = 0.4). Both groups experienced comparable reductions in leptin, free androgen index, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure and increases in sex hormone binding globulin, IGF binding proteins 1 and 2. Reductions in fasting insulin and insulin resistance were modest in both groups, but greater with IER than with CER; difference between groups for fasting insulin was -1.2 (-1.4 to -1.0) μU ml(-1) and for insulin resistance was -1.2 (-1.5 to -1.0) μU mmol(-1) l(-1) (both P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: IER is as effective as CER with regard to weight loss, insulin sensitivity and other health biomarkers, and may be offered as an alternative equivalent to CER for weight loss and reducing disease risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective was to investigate in a group of obese subjects the course in skeletal muscle phospholipid (SMPL) fatty acids (FA) during a 24-weeks weight maintenance program, which was preceded by a successful very low calorie dietary intervention (VLCD). Special focus was addressed to SMPL omega-3 FA, which is a lipid entity that influences insulin action.
METHODS: Nine obese subjects (BMI = 35.7 +/- 1.0 kg/m(2)), who had completed an 8 weeks VLCD (weight-loss = -9.7 +/- 1.6 kg, P {\textless} 0.001), had obtained skeletal muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) before and after a dietician-guided 24-weeks weight-maintenance program (-1.2 +/- 1.5 kg, P = ns). SMPL FA composition was determined by gas liquid chromatography. During the preceding VLCD, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) and glycemic control (HbA1c) improved but no change in SMPL omega-3 FA was observed. During the weight-maintenance program five subjects received the pancreas lipase inhibitor Orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. versus placebo.
RESULTS: HOMA-IR and HbA1c stabilized and SMPL total omega-3 FA, docosahexaenoic acid and ratio of n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated FA increased by 24\% (P {\textless} 0.01), 35\% (P {\textless} 0.02) and 26\% (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively, whereas saturated and monounsaturated FA did not change. Plasma total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, which decreased during the VLCD, reverted to pre-VLCD levels (P {\textless} 0.01). Orlistat therapy was associated with weight-loss (P {\textless} 0.05), trends for better glycemic control (P = 0.15) and greater increase in SMPL docosahexaenoic acid (P = 0.12) but similar reversal of plasma cholesterols compared to placebo.
CONCLUSION: The data are consistent with the notion that greater SMPL omega-3 FA obtained during a weight-maintenance program may play a role for preserving insulin sensitivity and glycemic control being generated during a preceding VLCD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Alternate day fasting may extend lifespan in rodents and is feasible for short periods in nonobese humans. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 3 weeks of alternate day fasting on glucose tolerance and skeletal muscle expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport/oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and stress response.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Glucose and insulin responses to a standard meal were tested in nonobese subjects (eight men and eight women; BMI, 20 to 30 kg/m(2)) at baseline and after 22 days of alternate day fasting (36 hour fast). Muscle biopsies were obtained from a subset of subjects (n = 11) at baseline and on day 21 (12-hour fast).
RESULTS: Glucose response to a meal was slightly impaired in women after 3 weeks of treatment (p {\textless} 0.01), but insulin response was unchanged. However, men had no change in glucose response and a significant reduction in insulin response (p {\textless} 0.03). There were no significant changes in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis or fatty acid transport/oxidation, although a trend toward increased CPT1 expression was observed (p {\textless} 0.08). SIRT1 mRNA expression was increased after alternate day fasting (p = 0.01).
DISCUSSION: Alternate day fasting may adversely affect glucose tolerance in nonobese women but not in nonobese men. The gene expression results indicate that fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis are unaffected by alternate day fasting. However, the increased expression in SIRT1 suggests that alternate day fasting may improve stress resistance, a commonly observed feature of calorie-restricted rodents.},

OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, we examined the effects of an IFCR diet on adipokine profile, body composition, and markers of CHD risk in obese women.
METHODS: Subjects (n = 54) were randomized to either the IFCR-liquid (IFCR-L) or IFCR-food based (IFCR-F) diet for 10 weeks.
RESULTS: Greater decreases in body weight and waist circumference were noted in the IFCR-L group (4 ± 1 kg; 6 ± 1 cm) versus the IFCR-F group (3 ± 1 kg; 4 ± 1 cm). Similar reductions (P {\textless} 0.0001) in fat mass were demonstrated in the IFCR-L (3 ± 1 kg) and IFCR-F group (2 ± 1 kg). Reductions in total and LDL cholesterol levels were greater (P = 0.04) in the IFCR-L (19 ± 10\%; 20 ± 9\%, respectively) versus the IFCR-F group (8 ± 3\%; 7 ± 4\%, respectively). LDL peak particle size increased (P {\textless} 0.01) in the IFCR-L group only. The proportion of small LDL particles decreased (P {\textless} 0.01) in both groups. Adipokines, such as leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) decreased (P {\textless} 0.05), in the IFCR-L group only.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFCR with a liquid diet favorably modulates visceral fat and adipokines in a way that may confer protection against CHD.},

Both IF and CR enhance cardiovascular and brain functions and improve several risk factors for coronary artery disease and stroke including a reduction in blood pressure and increased insulin sensitivity. Cardiovascular stress adaptation is improved and heart rate variability is increased in rodents maintained on an IF or a CR diet. Moreover, rodents maintained on an IF regimen exhibit increased resistance of heart and brain cells to ischemic injury in experimental models of myocardial infarction and stroke. The beneficial effects of IF and CR result from at least two mechanisms--reduced oxidative damage and increased cellular stress resistance. Recent findings suggest that some of the beneficial effects of IF on both the cardiovascular system and the brain are mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling in the brain. Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects of IF and CR on the cardiovascular system and the brain are similar to those of regular physical exercise, suggesting shared mechanisms. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IF and CR affect the blood vessels and heart and brain cells will likely lead to novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for extending health span.},

Prophylactic dietary restriction (DR) robustly extends animal lifespan, and is beneficial in models of neuronal insult. In rats, we found that one form of DR, every-other-day-fasting (EODF), which started 1 month prior to a cervical SCI improved functional recovery, resulted in greater numbers of neurons surrounding the injury site, and a approximately 45\% reduction in lesion size compared to the control group. In the light of the low-risk implementation of prophylactic EODF, the clinical translation as a treatment prior to elective subacute or chronic interventions is attractive. There are numerous secondary complications after human SCI, including a 13- to 25-year reduction in lifespan. DR consistently increases median and maximal lifespan in a large range of organisms, including non-human primates. Animal research suggests that EODF might reduce many of the secondary complications people with SCI suffer from.

	abstract = {Spinal cord injury typically results in limited functional recovery. Here we investigated whether therapeutic dietary restriction, a multi-faceted, safe, and clinically-feasible treatment, can improve outcome from cervical spinal cord injury. The well-established notion that dietary restriction increases longevity has kindled interest in its potential benefits in injury and disease. When followed for several months prior to insult, prophylactic dietary restriction triggers multiple molecular responses and improves outcome in animal models of stroke and myocardial infarction. However, the efficacy of the clinically-relevant treatment of post-injury dietary restriction is unknown. Here we report that "every-other-day fasting" (EODF), a form of dietary restriction, implemented after rat cervical spinal cord injury was neuroprotective, promoted plasticity, and improved behavioral recovery. Without causing weight loss, EODF improved gait-pattern, forelimb function during ladder-crossing, and vertical exploration. In agreement, EODF preserved neuronal integrity, dramatically reduced lesion volume by {\textgreater}50\%, and increased sprouting of corticospinal axons. As expected, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, a ketone known to be neuroprotective, were increased by 2-3 fold on the fasting days. In addition, we found increased ratios of full-length to truncated trkB (receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the spinal cord by 2-6 folds at both 5 days (lesion site) and 3 weeks after injury (caudal to lesion site) which may further enhance neuroprotection and plasticity. Because EODF is a safe, non-invasive, and low-cost treatment, it could be readily translated into the clinical setting of spinal cord injury and possibly other insults.},

Meta-analyses are increasingly used to address this problem, and they often evaluate observational studies. A workshop was held in Atlanta, Ga, in April 1997, to examine the reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies and to make recommendations to aid authors, reviewers, editors, and readers.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven participants were selected by a steering committee, based on expertise in clinical practice, trials, statistics, epidemiology, social sciences, and biomedical editing. Deliberations of the workshop were open to other interested scientists. Funding for this activity was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
EVIDENCE: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using MEDLINE, Educational Research Information Center (ERIC), PsycLIT, and the Current Index to Statistics. We also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved and contacted experts in the field. Participants were assigned to small-group discussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity, study categorization, and statistical methods.
CONSENSUS PROCESS: From the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a checklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational studies. The checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference attendees and additional experts. All suggestions for revisions were addressed.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Use of the checklist should improve the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers, and decision makers. An evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are explored.},

Fasting resulted in significant (p{\textless}0.05) decreases in the mean values of both, weight and the BMI. Similarly, the mean values of glucose and cholesterol were significantly decreased in subjects after Ramadan, although none of these decreases reached to a level with pathological significance. Conversely, no significant changes in serum levels of triglyceride were noted.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ramadan is the holiest month in the Islamic calendar and Muslims fast during this month. We designed this study to evaluate the effect of Ramadan fasting on plasma lipids and lipoproteins.
METHODS: This cohort study was performed during Ramadan in December 2002 (Islamic year 1423). The subjects were 81 students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. We evaluated weight, body mass index (BMI), glucose, triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), before and after Ramadan.
RESULTS: Body weight and BMI both decreased during Ramadan fasting in both genders. Glucose and HDL decreased and LDL increased significantly during fasting in Ramadan, but there was no significant change in total cholesterol, TG and VLDL. We did not find any association between TG, cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, HDL and the following variables: sex, body weight changes, and two or three instances of meals before Ramadan. Triglyceride level also increased in students with normal BMI while it decreased in overweight subjects.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that Ramadan fasting led to a decrease in glucose and weight. Although there was a significant reduction in meal frequency, a significant increase in LDL and decrease in HDL was noted during Ramadan. It seems that the effect of Ramadan fasting on serum lipid levels may be closely related to the nutritional diet or biochemical response to starvation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Muslims abstain from food and fluid between the hours of sunrise to sunset, and usually eat a large meal after sunset and a lighter meal before sunrise. The purpose of this study was to assess body composition, nutrient intake and physical activity patterns during Ramadan fasting.
METHODS: This study was carried out during Ramadan in October 2004. A total of 57 female subjects were recruited from The Hashemite University in Jordan. Body weight, fat percentage, muscle mass, and percentage body water content were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Estimated food records over a duration of three days were used to assess the intake of energy, carbohydrates, protein, fat, and sugars before and during Ramadan fasting. Physical activity patterns were determined from a three-day activity diary before and during Ramadan fasting; the amount of physical activity was expressed as the physical activity level.
RESULTS: Body weight and BMI decreased significantly during Ramadan fasting. The mean energy and nutrients intake before Ramadan (energy; percent carbohydrates:protein:fat was 1,252; 56:12:33) and during Ramadan (1,171; 56:13:34) were not significantly different. The mean physical activity level was 1.54 before Ramadan and 1.51 during Ramadan, and this was also not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that there was a significant weight loss during Ramadan. Estimates of energy, carbohydrates, protein, fat and sugar did not change, despite the reduction in the number of meals taken. The overall activity patterns remained similar.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: During the month of Ramadan, fasting is obligatory for all healthy adult Muslims, with the only exempted adults being those who have to travel or are sick. The aim of this study was to see whether changes in food intake and meal patterns during Ramadan fasting could modify serum lipid and lipoprotein parameters in healthy Algerian young men and women volunteers. The time-course prospective study was done in order to investigate at what time eventual changes to these parameters occur during Ramadan and their disappearance after Ramadan.
METHODS: Subjects were interviewed by trained interviewers using the method of the "seven day recall and record", before, during and after Ramadan. The serum lipid and lipoprotein contents were analysed at different times.
RESULTS: The total energy intake was higher during Ramadan (13 and 11 MJ/day) than before and after Ramadan (11 and 9 MJ/day) in men and women, respectively. In the second week of Ramadan, carbohydrate intake was elevated by 22 percent and 24 percent in men and women, respectively, compared to before and after Ramadan. At the end of Ramadan, the low density lipoproteins (LDL) percentages decreased by 20 percent in women and 55 percent in men compared to the values obtained before Ramadan. In both groups, the amount of serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) was 1.4-fold higher, in particular on day 28 of Ramadan, in comparison with the period before and after Ramadan. Indeed, a progressive decrease in LDL-C was noted in women and was particularly drastic in men. In contrast, HDL-C had increased by 30 percent on day 15 of Ramadan, compared to before Ramadan.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that striking changes in nutritional habits during Ramadan may be useful in reducing LDL levels and in increasing HDL levels. The young Muslim's diet during Ramadan may contribute to favourable modifications of the serum lipoprotein profile related to cardiovascular protection.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Ramadan fasting on several biochemical and anthropometric parameters in physically active men by comparing fasters and nonfasters before, during, and after Ramadan.
METHODS: Eighteen physically active men (10 fasters and 8 nonfasters) participated in this study. Subjects visited the laboratory for a total of four sessions on the following occasions: three days before Ramadan (Bef-R), the 15(th) day of Ramadan (Mid-R), the 29(th) day of Ramadan (End-R), and 21 days after Ramadan (Post-R). During each session, subjects underwent anthropometric measurements, completed a dietary questionnaire and provided a fasting blood sample.
RESULTS: Body weight and body fat percentage decreased in fasters by 1.9\% (P{\textless}0.001) and 6.2\% (P=0.003), respectively, but increased in nonfasters by 2.2\% (P{\textless}0.001) and 10.2\% (P=0.001), respectively, from Bef-R to End-R. Fasters' hematocrit and hemoglobin increased by 5.3\% (P{\textless}0.001) and 6.3\% (P=0.01), respectively, from Bef-R to End-R, while neither of these parameters changed in nonfasters. Fasters experienced an increase in the following parameters from Bef-R to End-R: urea (8.7\%; P{\textless}0.001), creatinine (7.5\%; P{\textless}0.001), uric acid (12.7\%; P{\textless}0.001), serum sodium (1.9\%; P{\textless}0.001), serum chloride (2.6\%; P{\textless}0.001) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (27.3\%; P{\textless}0.001). Of these parameters, only creatinine increased (4.4\%; P=0.01) in nonfasters.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that Ramadan fasting lowers body weight and body fat percentage and can elevate high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in physically active men. However, practicing aerobic exercise during a hot and humid Ramadan month can induce a state of dehydration marked by an increase in some renal function markers and serum electrolytes.},

	abstract = {A lipolytic process in skeletal muscle has recently been demonstrated. However, the physiological importance of this process is unknown. We investigated the role of skeletal muscle lipolysis for lipid utilization during caloric restriction in eight obese women before and after 11 days of very low-calorie diet (VLCD) (2.2 MJ per day). Subjects were studied with indirect calorimetry and microdialysis of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in order to analyze substrate utilization and glycerol (lipolysis index) in connection with a two-step euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (12 and 80 mU/m(2). min) clamp. Local blood flow rates in the two tissues were determined with (133)Xe-clearance. Circulating free fatty acids and glycerol decreased to a similar extent during insulin infusion before and during VLCD, and there was a less marked insulin-induced reduction in lipid oxidation during VLCD. Adipose tissue glycerol release was hampered by insulin infusion to the same extent ( approximately 40\%) before and during VLCD. Skeletal muscle glycerol release was not influenced by insulin before VLCD. However, during VLCD insulin caused a marked (fivefold) (P {\textless} 0.01) increase in skeletal muscle glycerol release. The effect was accompanied by a fourfold stimulation of skeletal muscle blood flow (P {\textless} 0.01). We propose that, during short-term caloric restriction, the reduced ability of insulin to inhibit lipids, despite a preserved antilipolytic effect of the hormone in adipose tissue, is caused by an augmented mobilization of fat from skeletal muscle, and that a physiological role of muscle lipolysis provides a local source of fatty acids.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Prolonged calorie restriction increases life span in rodents. Whether prolonged calorie restriction affects biomarkers of longevity or markers of oxidative stress, or reduces metabolic rate beyond that expected from reduced metabolic mass, has not been investigated in humans.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of 6 months of calorie restriction, with or without exercise, in overweight, nonobese (body mass index, 25 to {\textless}30) men and women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial of healthy, sedentary men and women (N = 48) conducted between March 2002 and August 2004 at a research center in Baton Rouge, La.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 groups for 6 months: control (weight maintenance diet); calorie restriction (25\% calorie restriction of baseline energy requirements); calorie restriction with exercise (12.5\% calorie restriction plus 12.5\% increase in energy expenditure by structured exercise); very low-calorie diet (890 kcal/d until 15\% weight reduction, followed by a weight maintenance diet).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body composition; dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), glucose, and insulin levels; protein carbonyls; DNA damage; 24-hour energy expenditure; and core body temperature.
RESULTS: Mean (SEM) weight change at 6 months in the 4 groups was as follows: controls, -1.0\% (1.1\%); calorie restriction, -10.4\% (0.9\%); calorie restriction with exercise, -10.0\% (0.8\%); and very low-calorie diet, -13.9\% (0.7\%). At 6 months, fasting insulin levels were significantly reduced from baseline in the intervention groups (all P{\textless}.01), whereas DHEAS and glucose levels were unchanged. Core body temperature was reduced in the calorie restriction and calorie restriction with exercise groups (both P{\textless}.05). After adjustment for changes in body composition, sedentary 24-hour energy expenditure was unchanged in controls, but decreased in the calorie restriction (-135 kcal/d [42 kcal/d]), calorie restriction with exercise (-117 kcal/d [52 kcal/d]), and very low-calorie diet (-125 kcal/d [35 kcal/d]) groups (all P{\textless}.008). These "metabolic adaptations" ({\textasciitilde} 6\% more than expected based on loss of metabolic mass) were statistically different from controls (P{\textless}.05). Protein carbonyl concentrations were not changed from baseline to month 6 in any group, whereas DNA damage was also reduced from baseline in all intervention groups (P {\textless}.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that 2 biomarkers of longevity (fasting insulin level and body temperature) are decreased by prolonged calorie restriction in humans and support the theory that metabolic rate is reduced beyond the level expected from reduced metabolic body mass. Studies of longer duration are required to determine if calorie restriction attenuates the aging process in humans.

Weight loss induced by negative energy balance reduces markers of oxidation in experimental animals and humans.

The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of 20\% caloric restriction or 20\% exercise alone over 1 year on oxidative damage to DNA and RNA, as assessed through white blood cell and urine analyses. Eighteen men and women aged 50 to 60 years with a body mass index (BMI) between 23.5 to 29.9 kg/m(2) were assigned to one of two conditions--20\% CR (n = 9) or 20\% EX (n = 9)--which was designed to produce an identical energy deficit through increased energy expenditure. Compared to baseline, both interventions significantly reduced oxidative damage to both DNA (48.5\% and 49.6\% reduction for the CR and EX groups, respectively) and RNA (35.7\% and 52.1\% reduction for the CR and EX groups, respectively) measured in white blood cells. However, urinary levels of DNA and RNA oxidation products did not differ from baseline values following either 12-month intervention program. Data from the present study provide evidence that negative energy balances induced through either CR or EX result in substantial and similar improvements in markers of DNA and RNA damage to white blood cells, potentially by reducing systemic oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: We determined the effects of acute and chronic calorie restriction with either a low-fat, high-carbohydrate (HC) diet or a low-carbohydrate (LC) diet on hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.
METHODS: Twenty-two obese subjects (body mass index, 36.5 +/- 0.8 kg/m2) were randomized to an HC ({\textgreater}180 g/day) or LC ({\textless}50 g/day) energy-deficit diet. A euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, muscle biopsy specimens, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to determine insulin action, cellular insulin signaling, and intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content before, after 48 hours, and after approximately 11 weeks (7\% weight loss) of diet therapy.
RESULTS: At 48 hours, IHTG content decreased more in the LC than the HC diet group (29.6\% +/- 4.8\% vs 8.9\% +/- 1.4\%; P {\textless} .05) but was similar in both groups after 7\% weight loss (LC diet, 38.0\% +/- 4.5\%; HC diet, 44.5\% +/- 13.5\%). Basal glucose production rate decreased more in the LC than the HC diet group at 48 hours (23.4\% +/- 2.2\% vs 7.2\% +/- 1.4\%; P {\textless} .05) and after 7\% weight loss (20.0\% +/- 2.4\% vs 7.9\% +/- 1.2\%; P {\textless} .05). Insulin-mediated glucose uptake did not change at 48 hours but increased similarly in both groups after 7\% weight loss (48.4\% +/- 14.3\%; P {\textless} .05). In both groups, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase decreased by 29\% +/- 13\% and phosphorylation of Akt and insulin receptor substrate 1 increased by 35\% +/- 9\% and 36\% +/- 9\%, respectively, after 7\% weight loss (all P {\textless} .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate calorie restriction causes temporal changes in liver and skeletal muscle metabolism; 48 hours of calorie restriction affects the liver (IHTG content, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and glucose production), whereas moderate weight loss affects muscle (insulin-mediated glucose uptake and insulin signaling).},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Previous clinical studies concerning the impact of body weight loss on single plasma TSH concentration measurements or the TSH response to TRH in obese humans have shown variable results.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of weight loss induced by caloric restriction on diurnal TSH concentrations and secretion in obese humans.
DESIGN: This was a clinical, prospective, crossover study.
SETTING: The study was conducted at the Clinical Research Center of Leiden University Medical Center.
PARTICIPANTS: Eleven obese premenopausal women (body mass index, 33.3 +/- 0.7 kg/m2) were studied.
INTERVENTION: The study intervention was weight loss (50\% reduction overweight by caloric restriction).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Twenty-four-hour plasma TSH concentrations (10-min intervals) and the 24-h TSH secretion rate, calculated by a waveform-independent deconvolution technique (Pulse), were determined.
RESULTS: The 24-h TSH secretion rate was significantly higher in obese women than in normal weight controls, and weight loss was accompanied by diminished TSH release (before weight loss, 43.4 +/- 6.4 mU/liter.24 h; after weight loss, 34.4 +/- 5.9 mU/liter.24 h; P = 0.02). Circulating free T3 levels decreased after weight loss from 4.3 +/- 0.19 to 3.8 +/- 0.14 pmol/liter (P = 0.04). Differences in 24-h TSH release correlated positively with the decline of circulating leptin (r2 = 0.62; P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: Elevated TSH secretion in obese women is significantly reduced by diet-induced weight loss. Among various physiological cues, leptin may be involved in this phenomenon. The decreases in TSH and free T3 may blunt energy expenditure in response to long-term calorie restriction, thereby frustrating weight loss attempts of obese individuals.},

	abstract = {The use of low-calorie diets is a common strategy for body-weight reduction purposes, but the time-course of the metabolic changes induced by moderately energy-restricted, otherwise balanced, diets is still poorly known. The aim of this nutritional intervention design was to study in obese women the effect of a balanced low-calorie diet on the metabolic rate, and metabolic fuel utilization changes during the weight loss process through the application of breath tests with stable isotope-labeled tracers. Seven obese (body mass index {\textgreater}30 kg/m(2)) women were assigned to a 10-week dietary hypoenergetic intervention regime supplying 55\% of energy as carbohydrate, 30\% as fat and 15\% as protein. Metabolic rate and substrate utilization were evaluated for 6 h in separate occasions during the weight loss program by indirect calorimetry and after 13C-labeled glucose, triolein and leucine administration. Body weight loss after 10 weeks was 4.2+/-1.1 kg, while the percent body fat decrease was about 5\%. Slimming was accompanied by a marked decrease in fasting leptin (about 25\%). Postprandial carbohydrate utilization after the administration of a test meal with the same macronutrient distribution as the experimental low-energy diet was decreased (24.1\%, P{\textless}0.05) as a consequence of the dietary restriction, which was associated with lower insulin plasma levels (P{\textless}0.05). Although protein and lipid oxidation were not significantly different after weight reduction (day 1 versus day 70), the metabolic utilization of these substrates tended to increase. Moreover, marginally significant indications obtained on days 15 and 45 suggest that the weight and body composition changes are attributable to a shift in endogenous and exogenous glucose utilization in favor of lipid burning. The breath tests determinations, which were performed on different occasions along the experimental trial, confirmed that the cumulative 13C output decreased for labeled tracers with time, being only statistically significant for the glucose utilization between days 15 and 45. In summary, the weight and fat mass losses were associated with a lower carbohydrate oxidation, which were probably compensated by an increase in lipid oxidation without major changes in protein mobilization.},

DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized 2-year clinical trial performed at the Department of Body Composition and Metabolism, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden.
SUBJECTS: A total of 334 patients, body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater}30 kg m-2, aged 18-60 years.
INTERVENTIONS: All the patients started with 16 VLCD weeks. Subjects in the intermittent group were then scheduled to use VLCD for 2 weeks every third month, whilst patients in the on-demand group were instructed to use VLCD whenever their body weight passed an individualized cut-off level. Irrespective of the treatment group, all the subjects were recommended a hypocaloric diet during VLCD-free periods.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in body weight, body composition, anthropometric variables and cardiovascular risk factors.
RESULTS: Completers in both groups maintained highly significant weight losses after 2 years: 7.0 +/- 11.0 kg (6.2 +/- 9.5\%) in the intermittent group and 9.1 +/- 9.7 kg (7.7 +/- 8.1\%) in the on-demand group (P {\textless} 0.001, ns between groups). Male completers in the on-demand group lost significantly more weight than men in the intermittent group, 14.5 +/- 11.0 kg vs. 4.0 +/- 10.5 kg, respectively (P {\textless} 0.01). Most cardiovascular risk factors improved during the first year, whilst anthropometric measures, insulin, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol were also significantly improved after 2 years of treatment.
CONCLUSION: Clinically significant weight reductions were achieved after 2 years of VLCD-based treatment. The structure of VLCD treatment during the maintenance phase did not affect weight loss in the total study population, whilst male subjects might benefit from the VLCD on-demand strategy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to determine the relationships among total body fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), fat cell size (FCS), ectopic fat deposition in liver (intrahepatic lipid [IHL]) and muscle (intramyocellular lipid [IMCL]), and insulin sensitivity index (S(i)) in healthy overweight, glucose-tolerant subjects and the effects of calorie restriction by diet alone or in conjunction with exercise on these variables.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-eight overweight volunteers were randomly assigned to four groups: control (100\% of energy requirements), 25\% calorie restriction (CR), 12.5\% calorie restriction +12.5\% energy expenditure through structured exercise (CREX), or 15\% weight loss by a low-calorie diet followed by weight maintenance for 6 months (LCD). Weight, percent body fat, VAT, IMCL, IHL, FCS, and S(i) were assessed at baseline and month 6.
RESULTS: At baseline, FCS was related to VAT and IHL (P {\textless} 0.05) but not to IMCL. FCS was also the strongest determinant of S(i) (P {\textless} 0.01). Weight loss at month 6 was 1 +/- 1\% (control, mean +/- SE), 10 +/- 1\% (CR), 10 +/- 1\% (CREX), and 14 +/- 1\% (LCD). VAT, FCS, percent body fat, and IHL were reduced in the three intervention groups (P {\textless} 0.01), but IMCL was unchanged. S(i) was increased at month 6 (P = 0.05) in the CREX (37 +/- 18\%) and LCD (70 +/- 34\%) groups (P {\textless} 0.05) and tended to increase in the CR group (40 +/- 20\%, P = 0.08). Together the improvements in S(i) were related to loss in weight, fat mass, and VAT, but not IHL, IMCL, or FCS.
CONCLUSIONS: Large adipocytes lead to lipid deposition in visceral and hepatic tissues, promoting insulin resistance. Calorie restriction by diet alone or with exercise reverses this trend.},

PURPOSE: To determine whether a 25\% energy deficit that produces equal change in body fatness leads to greater cardiometabolic benefits when aerobic exercise is included.
METHODS: Thirty-six overweight participants (16 males/20 females) (39 +/- 1 yr; 82 +/- 2 kg; body mass index = 27.8 +/- 0.3 kg x m2, mean +/- SEM) were randomized to one of three groups (n = 12 for each) for a 6-month intervention: control (CO, weight-maintenance diet), caloric restriction (CR, 25\% reduction in energy intake), or caloric restriction plus aerobic exercise (CR + EX, 12.5\% reduction in energy intake plus 12.5\% increase in exercise energy expenditure). Food was provided during weeks 1-12 and 22-24. Changes in fat mass, visceral fat, VO2peak (graded treadmill test), muscular strength (isokinetic knee extension/flexion), blood lipids, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity/secretion were compared.
RESULTS: As expected, VO2peak was significantly improved after 6 months of intervention in CR + EX only (22 +/- 5\% vs 7 +/- 5\% in CR and -5 +/- 3\% in CO), whereas isokinetic muscular strength did not change. There was no difference in the losses of weight, fat mass, or visceral fat and changes in systolic blood pressure (BP) between the intervention groups. However, only CR + EX had a significant decrease in diastolic BP (-5 +/- 3\% vs -2 +/- 2\% in CR and -1 +/- 2\% in CO), in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-13 +/- 4\% vs -6 +/- 3\% in CR and 2 +/- 4\% in CO), and a significant increase in insulin sensitivity (66 +/- 22\% vs 40 +/- 20\% in CR and 1 +/- 11\% in CO).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar effect on fat losses, combining CR with exercise increased aerobic fitness in parallel with improved insulin sensitivity, LDL cholesterol, and diastolic BP. The results lend support for inclusion of an exercise component in weight loss programs to improve metabolic fitness.},

DESIGN: In a 12-week, double-blind study, we randomised 75 participants to either the HP- or the C-plan group. We recorded key metrics at 0 and 12 weeks.
RESULTS: The overall mean weight loss was 5 kg in the HP-plan group and 4.9 kg in the C-plan group (p = 0.72).

PURPOSE: Determine the effect of 6 months of CR with or without exercise on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and estimated 10-year CVD risk in healthy non-obese men and women.
METHODS: Thirty-six individuals were randomized to one of three groups for 6 months: Control, 100\% of energy requirements; CR, 25\% calorie restriction; CR+EX, 12.5\% CR+12.5\% increase in energy expenditure via aerobic exercise. CVD risk factors were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months.
RESULTS: After 6 months, CR and CR+EX lost approximately 10\% of body weight. CR significantly reduced triacylglycerol (-31+/-15mg/dL) and factor VIIc (-10.7+/-2.3\%). Similarly CR+EX reduced triacylglycerol (-22+/-8mg/dL) and additionally reduced LDL-C (-16.0+/-5.1mg/dL) and DBP (-4.0+/-2.1mmHg). In contrast, both triacylglycerol (24+/-14mg/dL) and factor VIIc (7.9+/-2.3\%) were increased in the Control group. HDL-cholesterol was increased in all groups while hsCRP was lower in the Controls versus CR+EX. Estimated 10-year CVD risk significantly declined from baseline by 29\% in CR (P{\textless}0.001) and 38\% in the CR+EX (P{\textless}0.001) while remaining unchanged in the Control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on combined favorable changes in lipid and blood pressure, caloric restriction with or without exercise that induces weight loss favorably reduces risk for CVD even in already healthy non-obese individuals.},

To clarify the role of microbiological culture analysis we aimed to evaluate whether in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or fibromyalgia (FM) a Mediterranean diet or an 8-day fasting period are associated with changes in fecal flora and whether changes in fecal flora are associated with clinical outcome.
METHODS: During a two-months-period 51 consecutive patients from an Integrative Medicine hospital department with an established diagnosis of RA (n = 16) or FM (n = 35) were included in the study. According to predefined clinical criteria and the subjects' choice the patients received a mostly vegetarian Mediterranean diet (n = 21; mean age 50.9 +/-13.3 y) or participated in an intermittent modified 8-day fasting therapy (n = 30; mean age 53.7 +/- 9.4 y). Quantitative aerob and anaerob bacterial flora, stool pH and concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were analysed from stool samples at the beginning, at the end of the 2-week hospital stay and at a 3-months follow-up. Clinical outcome was assessed with the DAS 28 for RA patients and with a disease severity rating scale in FM patients.
RESULTS: We found no significant changes in the fecal bacterial counts following the two dietary interventions within and between groups, nor were significant differences found in the analysis of sIgA and stool ph. Clinical improvement at the end of the hospital stay tended to be greater in fasting vs. non-fasting patients with RA (p = 0.09). Clinical outcome was not related to alterations in the intestinal flora.
CONCLUSION: Neither Mediterranean diet nor fasting treatments affect the microbiologically assessed intestinal flora and sIgA levels in patients with RA and FM. The impact of dietary interventions on the human intestinal flora and the role of the fecal flora in rheumatic diseases have to be clarified with newer molecular analysis techniques. The potential benefit of fasting treatment in RA and FM should be further tested in randomised trials.},

DESIGN: Longitudinal study.
SETTING: University and foundation hospitals.
SUBJECTS: Ten obese men and 10 premenopausal obese women.
INTERVENTIONS: Five men and five women took 800 kcal/day LCD and another five men and five women took 1400 kcal/day balanced deficit diet (BDD) during 4 weeks.
RESULTS: Plasma leptin levels in the LCD group decreased more markedly (46.2+/-14.6 to 13.2+/-3.6 ng/ml) than that expected for the decrement in percentage fat (39.0+/-1.7 to 35.9+/-1.7\%) and body mass index (BMI; 35.4+/-2.4 to 33.1+/-2.2 kg/m(2)), while that in the BDD group did not decrease significantly (14.9+/-3.5 to 13.4+/-2.8 ng/ml). The ratio of the decrease in leptin levels to that of BMI during the first week was significantly greater than that during the following 3 weeks (39.5+/-2.7 vs 29.3+/-2.1\%, P=0.017). The plasma insulin and T3 levels also fell substantially in the first week and continued to decrease during the entire course. Plasma leptin levels measured weekly in each subject were correlated well with insulin (r=0.586, P=0.0003) and T3 (r=0.785, P=0.0004). Multiple regression analyses after adjustment for the time course and BMI revealed that serum levels of T3 were independently correlated with plasma leptin levels (r=0.928, P{\textless}0.0001). The plasma NEFA level was markedly elevated during the first 2 weeks and decreased thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS: A rapid fall in leptin during the first week of LCD, coordinated by insulin, T3 and NEFA, should be beneficial for responding to decreased energy intake. Inversely, in view of the powerful effect of leptin on energy dissipation, the present findings suggest the potential usefulness of leptin in combination with caloric restriction for the treatment of obesity.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercise intensity may affect the selective loss of abdominal adipose tissue.
OBJECTIVE: This study showed whether aerobic exercise intensity affects the loss of abdominal fat and improvement in cardiovascular disease risk factors under conditions of equal energy deficit in women with abdominal obesity.
DESIGN: This was a randomized trial in 112 overweight and obese [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 25-40; waist circumference {\textgreater}88 cm], postmenopausal women assigned to one of three 20-wk interventions of equal energy deficit: calorie restriction (CR only), CR plus moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (CR + moderate-intensity), or CR plus vigorous-intensity exercise (CR + vigorous-intensity). The diet was a controlled program of underfeeding during which meals were provided at individual calorie levels (approximately 400 kcal/d). Exercise (3 d/wk) involved treadmill walking at an intensity of 45-50\% (moderate-intensity) or 70-75\% (vigorous-intensity) of heart rate reserve. The primary outcome was abdominal visceral fat volume.
RESULTS: Average weight loss for the 95 women who completed the study was 12.1 kg (+/-4.5 kg) and was not significantly different across groups. Maximal oxygen uptake ( O(2)max) increased more in the CR + vigorous-intensity group than in either of the other groups (P {\textless} 0.05). The CR-only group lost relatively more lean mass than did either exercise group (P {\textless} 0.05). All groups showed similar decreases in abdominal visceral fat (approximately 25\%; P {\textless} 0.001 for all). However, changes in visceral fat were inversely related to increases in O(2)max (P {\textless} 0.01). Changes in lipids, fasting glucose or insulin, and 2-h glucose and insulin areas during the oral-glucose-tolerance test were similar across treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: With a similar amount of total weight loss, lean mass is preserved, but there is not a preferential loss of abdominal fat when either moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise is performed during caloric restriction.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: There is debate over the independent and combined effects of dieting and increased physical activity on improving metabolic risk factors (body composition and fat distribution).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to conduct a randomized, controlled trial (CALERIE) to test the effect of a 25\% energy deficit by diet alone or diet plus exercise for 6 months on body composition and fat distribution.
DESIGN: This was a randomized, controlled trial.
SETTING: The study was conducted at an institutional research center.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five of 36 overweight but otherwise healthy participants (16 males, 19 females) completed the study.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to either control (healthy weight maintenance diet, n = 11), caloric restriction (CR; 25\% reduction in energy intake, n = 12), or caloric restriction plus exercise (CR+EX; 12.5\% reduction in energy intake + 12.5\% increase in exercise energy expenditure, n = 12) for 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and changes in abdominal fat distribution by multislice computed tomography were measured. Results: The calculated energy deficit across the intervention was not different between CR and CR+EX. Participants lost approximately 10\% of body weight (CR: - 8.3 +/- 0.8, CR+EX: - 8.1 +/- 0.8 kg, P = 1.00), approximately 24\% of fat mass (CR: - 5.8 +/- 0.6, CR+EX: - 6.4 +/- 0.6 kg, P = 0.99), and 27\% of abdominal visceral fat (CR: 0.9 +/- 0.2, CR+EX: 0.8 +/- 0.2 kg, P = 1.00). Both whole-body and abdominal fat distribution were not altered by the intervention.
CONCLUSION: Exercise plays an equivalent role to CR in terms of energy balance; however, it can also improve aerobic fitness, which has other important cardiovascular and metabolic implications.},

To evaluate the effect of CR on GH secretory dynamics; forty-three young (36.8 +/- 1.0 years), overweight (BMI 27.8 +/- 0.7) men (n = 20) and women (n = 23) were randomized into four groups; control = 100\% of energy requirements; CR = 25\% caloric restriction; CR + EX = 12.5\% CR + 12.5\% increase in energy expenditure by structured exercise; LCD = low calorie diet until 15\% weight reduction followed by weight maintenance.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: It has been suggested that weight loss can improve systemic inflammation associated with obesity by decreasing the adipose production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This suggestion, however, remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of weight loss on peripheral inflammatory markers and subcutaneous adipocytokine production.
DESIGN: Patients were studied at baseline, at the end of the weight loss period, and after 2 weeks of weight stabilisation.
SUBJECTS: Nineteen morbid obese non-diabetic patients and 20 lean control subjects.
INTERVENTION: During the weight loss period patients followed a 6-week low-calorie diet.
MEASUREMENTS: Plasma levels of inflammatory markers, maximal in vitro whole-blood cytokine production, subcutaneous adipose tissue expression and content of several cytokines.
RESULTS: Obese subjects had higher circulating levels of C reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), interleukin IL-6, IL-1 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFR). Weight loss was associated with a significant decrease in CRP, SAA, leucocytes and plasma IL-6. Maximal in vitro cytokine production of IL-1 and sTNFR1 increased during this period. Weight loss did not induce significant changes in the adipose concentrations of IL-6, IL-1 or sTNF-receptors. However, adipose expression of IL-6, IL-1, TNFalpha, membrane cofactor protein-1 and adiponectin increased at the end of the weight loss period. During weight maintenance, circulating inflammatory parameters increased and in some cases returned to baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: A low-calorie diet is associated with an improvement in the systemic inflammatory status. This seems to be due to energy restriction rather than to adipose mass loss, since inflammatory levels return to baseline soon after weight stabilisation. Furthermore, a negative energy balance and fat mobilisation are associated with increased subcutaneous cytokine adipose expression.},

	abstract = {Increased inflammation and weight loss are associated with a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD). Aerobic exercise may minimize the loss of bone and weight loss may contribute to a decrease in cytokines. We tested the hypothesis that aerobic exercise in combination with a weight loss program would decrease circulating concentrations of inflammatory markers, thus mediating changes in BMD. This was a nonrandomized controlled trial. Eighty-six overweight and obese postmenopausal women (50-70 years of age; BMI, 25-40 kg/m(2)) participated in a weight loss (WL; n = 40) or weight loss plus walking (WL + AEX; n = 46) program. Outcome measures included BMD and bone mineral content of the femoral neck and lumbar spine measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble receptors of IL-6, and TNF-alpha (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2; receptors in a subset of the population), VO(2) max, fat mass, and lean mass. Weight decreased in the WL (p {\textless} 0.001) and WL + AEX (p {\textless} 0.001) groups. VO(2) max increased (p {\textless} 0.001) after WL + AEX. There was a 2\% increase in femoral neck BMD in the WL + AEX group (p = 0.001), which was significantly different from the WL group. The change in sTNFR1 was significantly associated with the change in femoral neck BMD (p {\textless} 0.05). The change in VO(2) max was an independent predictor of the change in femoral neck BMD. Our findings suggest that the addition of aerobic exercise is recommended to decrease inflammation and increase BMD during weight loss in overweight postmenopausal women.},

This pilot study evaluates oxidative stress during short-term administration of a very low calorie diet in obese persons. Nine obese Type 2 diabetic patients (age 55+/-5 years, BMI 35.9+/-1.9 kg/m2) and nine obese non-diabetic control subjects (age 52+/-6 years, BMI 37.3+/-2.1 kg/m2) were treated by a very low calorie diet (600 kcal daily) during 8 days stay in the hospital. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (B-HB), ascorbic acid (AA), alpha-tocopherol (AT), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in erythrocytes were measured before and on day 3 and 8 of very low calorie diet administration.

There was a significant correlation between NEFA or B-HB and SOD activity (p{\textless}0.01). We conclude that one week of a very low calorie diet administration decreases oxidative stress in obese non-diabetic but only partly in diabetic persons.

In addition to caloric restriction modification of the type of dietary fat may provide further benefits. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of energy restriction alone and with dietary fat modification on weight loss and adiposity, as well as on risk factors for obesity related disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty overweight men and women were randomized into a 3month controlled trial with four low fat (30\% energy) dietary arms: (1) isocaloric (LF); (2) isocaloric with 10\% polyunsaturated fatty acids (LF-PUFA); (3) low calorie (LF-LC) (-2MJ); (4) low calorie with 10\% PUFA (LF-PUFA-LC). Primary outcomes were changes in body weight and body fat and secondary outcomes were changes in fasting levels of leptin, insulin, glucose, lipids and erythrocyte fatty acids. Changes in dietary intake were assessed using 3day food records. One-hundred and twenty-two participants entered the study and 95 completed the study. All groups lost weight and body fat (P{\textless}0.0001 time effect for both), but the LC groups lost more weight (P=0.026 for diet effect). All groups reduced total cholesterol levels (P{\textless}0.0001 time effect and P=0.017 intervention effect), but the LC and PUFA groups were better at reducing triacylglycerol levels (P=0.056 diet effect). HDL increased with LF-LC and LF-PUFA but not with LF-PUFA-LC (0.042 diet effect). The LF and LF-LC groups reported greater dietary fat reductions than the two PUFA groups (P=0.043).
CONCLUSION: Energy restriction has the most potent effect on weight loss and lipids, but fat modification is also beneficial when energy restriction is more modest.},

The effects on weight loss and body fat of a high-dairy diet and a diet high in dairy and fiber and low in glycemic index were compared with a standard diet.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Ninety obese subjects were recruited into a randomized trial of three diets designed to provide a calorie deficit of 500 calories/d over a 48-week period. The study compared a moderate (not low)-calcium diet with a high-calcium diet.
RESULTS: Seventy-two subjects completed the study. Significant weight and fat loss occurred with all three diets. A diet with 1400 mg of calcium did not result in greater weight (11.8 +/- 6.1 kg) or fat (9.0 +/- 6.0 kg) loss than a diet with 800 mg of calcium (10.0 +/- 6.8 and 7.5 +/- 6.6 kg, respectively). A diet with 1400 mg of calcium, increased fiber content, and fewer high-glycemic index foods did not result in greater weight (10.6 +/- 6.8 kg) or fat (8.5 +/- 7.8 kg) loss than the standard diet with 800 mg of calcium. Lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, leptin, fasting glucose, and insulin improved significantly, but there were no significant differences between the experimental diets and the control diet.
DISCUSSION: We found no evidence that diets higher than 800 mg of calcium in dairy products or higher in fiber and lower in glycemic index enhance weight reduction beyond what is seen with calorie restriction alone.},

Furthermore, find predictors of WM that can be important in the context of obesity treatment.
METHODS: In all, 120 subjects (age: 49.0+/-9.8 y, BMI 31.0+/-3.8 kg/m(2)) followed a VLCD (2.1 MJ/day) for 6 weeks in a free-living situation, followed by a period of 1 y WM. Body weight (BW), body composition, leptin concentration, dietary restraint and physical activity were determined right before (t0) and after (t1) the VLCD, after 3 months (t2) and after 1 y (t3). During WM, subjects were divided into four categories of WM guidelines (dietary, activity, diet+activity, placebo), taking their capability measured during weight loss and their preference for particular guidelines into account.
RESULTS: BW loss during VLCD was 7.0+/-3.1 kg. After 1 y follow-up, BW regain was 56.3+/-55.0\%, without significant differences between the four groups. With respect to measured capability during weight loss, subjects with an increased dietary restraint (F1 of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire) had less BW regain than subjects with an increased physical activity (Baecke questionnaire) (35.5+/-53.2 vs 68.5+/-46.4\%, P{\textless}0.05). Moreover, activity guidelines promoted WM in dietary disciplined subjects compared to activity-related disciplined subjects (\% regain: 25.2 vs 74.3\%, P{\textless}0.05). Subjects receiving guidelines that were opposite to their preference showed a better WM than subjects receiving preferred guidelines. After 1 y WM, 21 subjects were successful ({\textless}10\% BW regain) and 99 unsuccessful ({\textgreater} or =10\% BW regain). At baseline, these groups were significantly different in BMI (resp. 32.7+/-4.9 vs 30.7+/-3.5 kg/m(2), P{\textless}0.05), waist circumference (106.5+/-14.0 vs 100.6+/-11.2 cm, P{\textless}0.05) and fat mass (FM) (35.2+/-10.6 vs 32.1+/-6.6\%, P=0.06). Finally, successful subjects appeared to spare fat-free mass (FFM) to a greater extent than unsuccessful subjects.
CONCLUSION: After weight loss, type of guidelines (dietary, activity, placebo) is not related to the magnitude of WM, whereas guidelines opposite to the subject's capability and preference are related. These only reach successful WM ({\textgreater}90\%) in originally dietary disciplined subjects who are supported by characteristics such as a relatively high baseline BMI, waist circumference and FM, together with the ability to spare FFM.},

Sealed inside, 4 men and 4 women maintained themselves and the various systems for 2 years. All organic material, all water, and nearly all air was recycled, and virtually all food was grown inside. On the low calorie but nutrient-dense diet available, the men sustained 18\% and the women 10\% weight loss, mostly within the first 6 to 9 months. The nature of the diet duplicated rodent diets that had been shown to enhance health, lower disease incidence, and retard aging. Using blood specimens frozen at different points during and after the 2 years, determinations were made of a number of biochemical parameters judged to be pertinent based on past studies of rodents and monkeys on similar diets. These included blood lipids, glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, renin, and others. The results clearly suggest that humans react to such a nutritional regime similarly to other vertebrates. In addition to these studies, and because this was a tightly closed, isolated environment, the levels of insecticides or pollutants or their derivatives were determined in the sera of 2 crew members. It was found that levels of the lipophilic toxicant DDE and the "total PCB" load increased with the loss of body fat during the first 12-18 months inside Biosphere 2, then decreased.},

These effects may not occur with exercise-induced weight loss (EX) because of the anabolic effects of exercise on heart and skeletal muscle. We tested the hypothesis that CR reduces muscle size and strength and VO2 max, whereas EX preserves or improves these parameters. Healthy 50- to 60-yr-old men and women (body mass index of 23.5-29.9 kg/m2) were studied before and after 12 mo of weight loss by CR (n = 18) or EX (n = 16). Lean mass was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, thigh muscle volume by MRI, isometric and isokinetic knee flexor strength by dynamometry, and treadmill VO2 max by indirect calorimetry. Both interventions caused significant decreases in body weight (CR: -10.7 +/- 1.4\%, EX: -9.5 +/- 1.5\%) and lean mass (CR: -3.5 +/- 0.7\%, EX: -2.2 +/- 0.8\%), with no significant differences between groups. Significant decreases in thigh muscle volume (-6.9 +/- 0.8\%) and composite knee flexion strength (-7.2 +/- 3\%) occurred in the CR group only. Absolute VO2 max decreased significantly in the CR group (-6.8 +/- 2.3\%), whereas the EX group had significant increases in both absolute (+15.5 +/- 2.4\%) and relative (+28.3 +/- 3.0\%) VO2 max. These data provide evidence that muscle mass and absolute physical work capacity decrease in response to 12 mo of CR but not in response to a similar weight loss induced by exercise. These findings suggest that, during EX, the body adapts to maintain or even enhance physical performance capacity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Weight loss, through calorie restriction or increases in energy expenditure via exercise, improves glucose tolerance and insulin action. However, exercise-induced energy expenditure may further improve glucoregulation through mechanisms independent of weight loss.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the hypothesis that weight loss through exercise-induced energy expenditure improves glucoregulation and circulating factors involved in insulin action to a greater extent than does similar weight loss through calorie restriction.
DESIGN: Sedentary men and women aged 50-60 y with a body mass index (kg/m(2)) of 23.5-29.9 were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 weight-loss interventions [12 mo of exercise training (EX group; n = 18) or calorie restriction (CR group; n = 18)] or to a healthy lifestyle (HL) control group (n = 10). The insulin sensitivity index and areas under the curve for glucose and insulin were assessed with an oral-glucose-tolerance test. Adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations were measured in fasting serum. Fat mass was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
RESULTS: Yearlong energy deficits were not significantly different between the EX and CR groups, as evidenced by body weight and fat mass changes. The insulin sensitivity index increased and the glucose and insulin areas under the curve decreased in the EX and CR groups, remained unchanged in the HL group, and did not differ significantly between the EX and CR groups. Marginally significant increases in adiponectin and decreases in the ratio of tumor necrosis factor alpha to adiponectin occurred in the EX and CR groups but not in the HL group.
CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss induced by exercise training or calorie restriction improves glucose tolerance and insulin action in nonobese, healthy, middle-aged men and women. However, it does not appear that exercise training-induced weight loss results in greater improvements than those that result from calorie restriction alone.},

We analyzed the relationship of the adipocyte-derived hormone adiponectin with indices of inflammation, adiposity, and insulin resistance in obese subjects with (MS+, n = 40) and without (MS-, n = 40) the metabolic syndrome and examined the acute effects of rapid weight loss. MS+ subjects had significantly lower adiponectin (7.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 10.4 +/- 0.6 microg/ml; P = 0.003) and significantly higher TNF-alpha (3.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.3 pg/ml; P = 0.004) levels compared with MS- subjects matched for age and body mass index. Plasma adiponectin and TNF-alpha levels were inversely related to the number of metabolic syndrome factors in a stepwise manner. After 4-6 wk of weight loss, there was marked improvement in glucose, insulin, leptin, and triglycerides, whereas adiponectin and TNF-alpha concentrations did not change. Thus, increases in plasma levels of adiponectin or reductions in TNF-alpha are not required for marked improvements in glucose/insulin and lipid metabolism with acute weight loss.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease is greatest in older obese patients, and effective evidence-based treatment strategies are lacking.
METHODS: A prospective controlled study was conducted on 24 older (65.5 +/- 5.0 years) obese (body mass index, 34.3 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2)) adults with clinically diagnosed metabolic syndrome. We examined the effect of exercise alone (EX) or exercise combined with moderate caloric restriction (-500 kcal, EX + CR) on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors. Measures of insulin sensitivity assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and by oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profiles, blood pressure, body composition, abdominal fat, and aerobic capacity were all obtained before and after the interventions.
RESULTS: Both groups experienced significant weight loss, but the reduction was greater in the EX + CR group than in the EX group (-6.8 +/- 2.7 kg vs -3.7 +/- 3.4 kg, respectively, p = .02). Both interventions improved insulin sensitivity (2.4 +/- 2.4 mg/kg FFM/min and 1.4 +/- 1.7 mg/kgFFM/min, respectively, p {\textless} .001) and indices of metabolic syndrome (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, glucose, and triglycerides; p {\textless} .05). High-density lipoprotein levels remained unchanged. Total abdominal, subcutaneous, and visceral fat; aerobic capacity; and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also improved. With the exception of weight loss and subcutaneous fat, there was no difference in the magnitude of improvement between the interventions.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that exercise alone is an effective nonpharmacological treatment strategy for insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in older obese adults.},

We hypothesized that the magnitude of this decline would predict the amount of weight lost in response to exogenous leptin administration. METHODS: Thirty obese subjects were mildly energy-restricted for 21 days. Subsequently, they were randomized to receive either recombinant human leptin [rL, 10 mg s.c. once (n=15) or twice (n=6) daily] or placebo (n=9) as an adjunct to the dietary measures for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Weight loss amounted to 2.8+/-1.1, 5.2+/-0.9, and 7.9+/-1.4 kg (mean+/-standard error) (p=0.035 vs. placebo) in placebo, rL once daily, and rL b.i.d. treated subjects, respectively. The reduction in plasma leptin concentrations during the initial 21 days was positively correlated with the loss of body weight following leptin treatment (r(2)=0.24, p=0.04). Plasma leptin concentration prior to the initiation of rL therapy was inversely associated with the amount of body weight lost in response to intervention (r(2)=0.36, p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Leptin administration counteracts the adaptations that are actuated by the drop in leptin concentrations and thereby disrupts energy balance to promote weight loss.},

	abstract = {Context: Weight loss using low-calorie diets produces variable results, presumably due to a wide range of energy deficits and low-dietary adherence.
Objective: Our objective was to quantify the relationship between dietary adherence, weight loss, and severity of caloric restriction.
Design and Setting: Participants were randomized to diet only, diet-endurance training, or diet-resistance training until body mass index (BMI) was less than 25 kg/m2.
Participants: Healthy overweight (BMI 27–30) premenopausal women (n = 141) were included in the study.
Interventions: An 800-kcal/d−1 diet was provided, and the exercise groups were engaged in three sessions per week.
Main Outcomes: Dietary adherence, calculated from total energy expenditure determined by doubly labeled water measurements and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry body composition changes, and degree of caloric restriction were determined.
Results: All groups had similar weight loss (∼12.1 ± 2.5 kg) and length of time to reach target BMI (∼158 ± 70 d). Caloric restriction averaged 59 ± 9\%, and adherence to diet was 73 ± 34\%. Adherence to diet was inversely associated to days to reach target BMI (r = −0.687; P {\textless} 0.01) and caloric restriction (r = −0.349; P {\textless} 0.01). Association between adherence to diet and percent weight lost as fat was positive for the diet-endurance training (r = 0.364; P {\textless} 0.05) but negatively correlated for the diet-only group (r = −0.387; P {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: Dietary adherence is strongly associated with rates of weight loss and adversely affected by the severity of caloric restriction. Weight loss programs should consider moderate caloric restriction relative to estimates of energy requirements, rather than generic low-calorie diets.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effects of 2 dietary macronutrient patterns with different glycemic loads on adherence to a prescribed regimen of calorie restriction (CR), weight and fat loss, and related variables.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of diets with a high glycemic load (HG) or a low glycemic load (LG) at 30\% CR was conducted in 34 healthy overweight adults with a mean (+/-SD) age of 35 +/- 6 y and body mass index (kg/m(2)) of 27.6 +/- 1.4. All food was provided for 6 mo in diets controlled for confounding variables, and subjects self-administered the plans for 6 additional months. Primary and secondary outcomes included energy intake measured by doubly labeled water, body weight and fatness, hunger, satiety, and resting metabolic rate.
RESULTS: All groups consumed significantly less energy during CR than at baseline (P {\textless} 0.01), but changes in energy intake, body weight, body fat, and resting metabolic rate did not differ significantly between groups. Both groups ate more energy than provided (eg, 21\% and 28\% CR at 3 mo and 16\% and 17\% CR at 6 mo with HG and LG, respectively). Percentage weight change at 12 mo was -8.04 +/- 4.1\% in the HG group and -7.81 +/- 5.0\% in the LG group. There was no effect of dietary composition on changes in hunger, satiety, or satisfaction with the amount and type of provided food during CR.

	abstract = {Increased reactive oxygen species generation by the leukocytes of the obese may be responsible for increased oxidative injury to lipids and proteins and, hence, atherosclerosis. We have investigated whether reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and other indexes of oxidative damage in the body fall with short-term dietary restriction and weight loss. Nine nondiabetic obese subjects (body mass index, 32.5-64.4 kg/m(2)), not taking any antioxidants, were put on a 1000-Cal diet. Fasting blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and at 12 weeks after the cessation of dietary restriction. Blood samples were also obtained at 1 and 2 h after administration of 75 g oral glucose at 0 and 4 weeks. Mononuclear cells (MNC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated, and reactive oxygen species generation was measured. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine as indexes of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and amino acids, respectively, were measured. Antioxidant vitamins were measured as indexes of antioxidant reserves. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were also measured. Mean weight loss was 2.4 +/- 0.6 kg at week 1, 2.5 +/- 1.7 kg at week 2, 3.9 +/- 0.8 kg at week 3, and 4.5 +/- 2.8 kg at week 4 (P {\textless} 0.05). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN fell from 236.4 +/- 95.8 to 150.9 +/- 69.0, 125.9 +/- 24.3, 96.0 +/- 39.9, and 103.1 +/- 35.7 mV at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). It increased 3 months after the cessation of dietary restriction to 270.0 +/- 274.3 mV. Reactive oxygen species generation by MNC fell from 187.8 +/- 75.0 to 101.7 +/- 64.5, 86.9 +/- 42.8, 63.8 +/- 14.3, and 75.1 +/- 32.2 mV and increased thereafter to 302.0 +/- 175.5 mV at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 16 weeks, respectively (P {\textless} 0.005). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN and MNC increased in response to glucose; the relative increase was greater at 4 weeks than that at week 0 due to a fall in the basal levels of reactive oxygen species generation. Consistent with the fall in reactive oxygen species generation, there was a reduction in plasma TBARS from 1.68 +/- 0.17 micromol/L at week 0 to 1.47 micromol/L at 4 weeks (P {\textless} 0.05). The 13-HODE to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100\% to 56.4 +/- 36.1\% at 4 weeks (P {\textless} 0.05), and the 9-HODE to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100\% to 60.5 +/- 37.7\% at 4 weeks (P {\textless} 0.05). Carbonylated proteins fell from 1.39 +/- 0.27 microgram/mg protein at week 0 to 1.17 +/- 0.12 microgram/mg protein at week 4 (P {\textless} 0.05); o-tyrosine fell from 0.42 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.36 +/- 0.02 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P {\textless} 0.005), and m-tyrosine fell from 0.45 +/- 0.04 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.40 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P {\textless} 0.05). The basal concentrations of TBARS, 9-HODE, 13-HODE, carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in the obese were significantly greater than those in normal subjects. On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations did not change during this 4-week period, nor was there any change in antioxidant vitamins. This is the first demonstration of 1) an increase in reactive oxygen species-induced damage in lipids, proteins, and amino acids in the obese compared with normal subjects; and 2) a decrease in reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and amino acids after dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese over a short period.},

After the nutritional intervention, all obese subjects lost weight, specially those individuals who followed the legumes-enriched diet as compared to the CD ( - 7.7 +/- 3 vs. - 5.3 +/- 2.7\%; p = 0.023), which was accompanied by marked decreases in total cholesterol levels (p {\textless} 0.001) and statistically significant diet-related reductions on plasma ox-LDL, plasma MDA and urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) output. Therefore, a balanced diet with moderate caloric restriction including 4 day/week legume servings empowered the oxidative stress improvement related to weight loss through a reduction in lipid peroxidation as compared to a control hypocaloric diet.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Caloric restriction without malnutrition extends life span in a range of organisms including insects and mammals and lowers free radical production by the mitochondria. However, the mechanism responsible for this adaptation are poorly understood.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The current study was undertaken to examine muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics in response to caloric restriction alone or in combination with exercise in 36 young (36.8 +/- 1.0 y), overweight (body mass index, 27.8 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) individuals randomized into one of three groups for a 6-mo intervention: Control, 100\% of energy requirements; CR, 25\% caloric restriction; and CREX, caloric restriction with exercise (CREX), 12.5\% CR + 12.5\% increased energy expenditure (EE). In the controls, 24-h EE was unchanged, but in CR and CREX it was significantly reduced from baseline even after adjustment for the loss of metabolic mass (CR, -135 +/- 42 kcal/d, p = 0.002 and CREX, -117 +/- 52 kcal/d, p = 0.008). Participants in the CR and CREX groups had increased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial function such as PPARGC1A, TFAM, eNOS, SIRT1, and PARL (all, p {\textless} 0.05). In parallel, mitochondrial DNA content increased by 35\% +/- 5\% in the CR group (p = 0.005) and 21\% +/- 4\% in the CREX group (p {\textless} 0.004), with no change in the control group (2\% +/- 2\%). However, the activity of key mitochondrial enzymes of the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle (citrate synthase), beta-oxidation (beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and electron transport chain (cytochrome C oxidase II) was unchanged. DNA damage was reduced from baseline in the CR (-0.56 +/- 0.11 arbitrary units, p = 0.003) and CREX (-0.45 +/- 0.12 arbitrary units, p = 0.011), but not in the controls. In primary cultures of human myotubes, a nitric oxide donor (mimicking eNOS signaling) induced mitochondrial biogenesis but failed to induce SIRT1 protein expression, suggesting that additional factors may regulate SIRT1 content during CR.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed increase in muscle mitochondrial DNA in association with a decrease in whole body oxygen consumption and DNA damage suggests that caloric restriction improves mitochondrial function in young non-obese adults.},

	abstract = {The aim of our study was to determine whether adipocyte-derived hormones leptin, adiponectin and resistin contribute to the improvement of insulin sensitivity after very-low calorie diet (VLCD). Therefore, serum levels of these hormones were measured in fourteen obese females before and after three weeks VLCD and in seventeen age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Body mass index, HOMA index, serum insulin and leptin levels in obese women before VLCD were significantly higher than in control group (BMI 48.01+/-2.02 vs. 21.38+/-0.42 kg/m(2), HOMA 10.72+/-2.03 vs. 4.69+/-0.42, insulin 38.63+/-5.10 vs. 18.76+/-1.90 microIU/ml, leptin 77.87+/-8.98 vs. 8.82+/-1.52 ng/ml). In contrast, serum adiponectin and soluble leptin receptors levels were significantly lower in obese women before VLCD than in the control group. No differences were found in serum glucose and resistin levels between the obese group before VLCD and the control group. VLCD significantly decreased BMI, HOMA index, serum glucose, insulin and leptin levels and increased soluble leptin receptor levels. The changes in serum adiponectin and resistin levels in obese women after VLCD did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that leptin and soluble leptin receptor levels were affected by VLCD while adiponectin and resistin concentrations were not. Therefore, other mechanisms rather than changes in the endocrine function of the adipose tissue are probably involved in the VLCD-induced improvement of insulin sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Multiple health benefits of calorie restriction (CR) and alternate day fasting (ADF) regimens are widely recognized. Experimental data concerning the effects of calorie restriction on cardiac health are more controversial, ranging from evidence that ADF protects heart from ischemic damage but results in developing of diastolic dysfunction, to reports that CR ameliorates the age-associated diastolic dysfunction. Here we investigated the effects of chronic CR on morphology and function of the cardiovascular system of aged rats and cardioprotective effect of CR against ischemic damage in the experimental rat model of MI. Cardiovascular fitness of 24-month old Fisher 344 rats maintained through life on ad libitum (AL) or CR diets was extensively evaluated via echocardiography, dobutamine stress test, pressure-volume loop analyses, pulse wave velocity measurements, and histology. Groups of 2-month old AL and 29-month old CR rats were studied for comparison. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by a permanent ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery in 5-month old rats maintained for 3 months on CR or AL. MI size was evaluated histologically 24 hrs following coronary ligation. Cardiac remodeling was followed-up via echocardiography. Age-associated changes in 24-month old rats consisted of 33\% increase of fibrosis in the myocardium and more than 2 fold increase of the collagen in the tunica media of the aorta. There was a significant decrease in the density and total number of cardiomyocytes, while their size was increased. These morphological changes were manifested in a decline of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, increase of left ventricular and aortic stiffness, and arterio-ventricular uncoupling. Tachycardic response to dobutamine challenge was absent in the old rats. Compared to AL rats, 24-month old CR rats had reduced levels of cardiac and aortic fibrosis, increased density of cardiomyocytes that were smaller in size, attenuated diastolic dysfunction, normal systolic function and arterio-ventricular coupling. Tachycardic response to dobutamine was also intact in CR 24-month old rats and aortic stiffness was reduced. Adjustment for body weight differences through ratiometric or allometric scaling did not affect the overall pattern of differences between AL and CR rats. Attenuation of morphological and functional age-associated changes in 24-month old CR rats either was not observed at all or was smaller in 29-month old CR rats. Size of MI induced by a permanent coronary ligation as well as post-MI cardiac remodeling and function were similar in CR and AL rats. CR does not increase tolerance of myocardium to ischemic damage, but attenuates the age-associated changes in the heart and major vessels. The attenuation of age-associated changes by CR cannot be explained by the effect of lower body weight but are attributable to more intimate cellular mechanisms of CR itself. Attenuation of age-associated changes by CR waned with advancing age, and is consistent with the idea that CR postponed senescence.},

	abstract = {Considerable interest has been shown in the ability of caloric restriction (CR) to improve multiple parameters of health and to extend lifespan. CR is the reduction of caloric intake - typically by 20 - 40\% of ad libitum consumption - while maintaining adequate nutrient intake. Several alternatives to CR exist. CR combined with exercise (CE) consists of both decreased caloric intake and increased caloric expenditure. Alternate-day fasting (ADF) consists of two interchanging days; one day, subjects may consume food ad libitum (sometimes equaling twice the normal intake); on the other day, food is reduced or withheld altogether. Dietary restriction (DR) - restriction of one or more components of intake (typically macronutrients) with minimal to no reduction in total caloric intake - is another alternative to CR. Many religions incorporate one or more forms of food restriction. The following religious fasting periods are featured in this review: 1) Islamic Ramadan; 2) the three principal fasting periods of Greek Orthodox Christianity (Nativity, Lent, and the Assumption); and 3) the Biblical-based Daniel Fast. This review provides a summary of the current state of knowledge related to CR and DR. A specific section is provided that illustrates related work pertaining to religious forms of food restriction. Where available, studies involving both humans and animals are presented. The review includes suggestions for future research pertaining to the topics of discussion.},

	abstract = {The behavioural modifications that accompany Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) are usually associated with some alterations in the metabolic, physiological, and psychological responses of athletes that may affect sport performance. Muslim athletes who are required to train and/or compete during the month-long, diurnal fast must adopt coping strategies that allow them to maintain physical fitness and motivation if they are to perform at the highest level. This updated review aims to present the current state of knowledge of the effects of RIF on training and performance, focusing on key-factors that contribute to the effects of Ramadan on exercise performance: energy restriction, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm perturbation, dehydration, and alterations in the training load. The available literature contain few studies that have examined the effects of RIF on physical performance in athletes and, to date, the results are inconclusive, so the effects of RIF on competition outcomes are not at present wholly understood. The diverse findings probably indicate individual differences in the adaptability and self-generated coping strategies of athletes during fasting and training. However, the results of the small number of well-controlled studies that have examined the effects of Ramadan on athletic performance suggest that few aspects of physical fitness are negatively affected, and where decrements are observed these are usually modest. Subjective feelings of fatigue and other mood indicators are often cited as implying additional stress on the athlete throughout Ramadan, but most studies show that these factors may not result in decreases in performance and that perceived exercise intensity is unlikely to increase to any significant degree. Current evidence from good, well-controlled research supports the conclusion that athletes who maintain their total energy and macronutrient intake, training load, body composition, and sleep length and quality are unlikely to suffer any substantial decrements in performance during Ramadan. Further research is required to determine the effect of RIF on the most challenging events or exercise protocols and on elite athletes competing in extreme environments.},

	abstract = {An overnight fast of 8-10 h is normal for most people. Fasting is characterised by a coordinated set of metabolic changes designed to spare carbohydrate and increase reliance on fat as a substrate for energy supply. As well as sparing the limited endogenous carbohydrate, and increased rate of gluconeogenesis from amino acids, glycerol and ketone bodies help maintain the supply of carbohydrate. Many individuals undergo periodic fasts for health, religious or cultural reasons. Ramadan fasting, involving 1 month of abstention from food and fluid intake during daylight hours, is practised by a large part of the world population. This period involves a shift in the pattern of intake from daytime to the hours of darkness. There seems to be little effect on overall daily dietary intake and only small metabolic effects, but there may be implications for both physical and cognitive function. The limited evidence suggests that effects of Ramadan-style fasting on exercise performance are generally small. This needs to be balanced, however, against the observation that small differences in performance are critical in determining the outcomes of sporting events. Studies involving challenging sporting events (prolonged sustained or intermittent high-intensity events, hot and humid environments) are needed. Increases in subjective sensations of fatigue may be the result of loss of sleep or disruption of normal sleep patterns. Modifications to the competition timetable may minimise or even eliminate any effect on performance in sport, but there may be negative effects on performance in some events.},

While PP, MP and FI were greater in the evening than in the morning during BR (p{\textless}0.001), these diurnal variations in muscle power disappeared during the month of Ramadan (i. e., SWR and ER) due to a significant decrease in PP and MP in the evening (p{\textless}0.001).

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of ADF that is administered under controlled compared with self-implemented conditions on body weight and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk indicators in obese adults.
DESIGN: Sixteen obese subjects (12 women, 4 men) completed a 10-wk trial, which consisted of 3 phases: 1) a 2-wk control phase, 2) a 4-wk weight loss/ADF controlled food intake phase, and 3) a 4-wk weight loss/ADF self-selected food intake phase.
RESULTS: Dietary adherence remained high throughout the controlled food intake phase (days adherent: 86\%) and the self-selected food intake phase (days adherent: 89\%). The rate of weight loss remained constant during controlled food intake (0.67 +/- 0.1 kg/wk) and self-selected food intake phases (0.68 +/- 0.1 kg/wk). Body weight decreased (P {\textless} 0.001) by 5.6 +/- 1.0 kg (5.8 +/- 1.1\%) after 8 wk of diet. Percentage body fat decreased (P {\textless} 0.01) from 45 +/- 2\% to 42 +/- 2\%. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentrations decreased (P {\textless} 0.01) by 21 +/- 4\%, 25 +/- 10\%, and 32 +/- 6\%, respectively, after 8 wk of ADF, whereas HDL cholesterol remained unchanged. Systolic blood pressure decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) from 124 +/- 5 to 116 +/- 3 mm Hg.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ADF is a viable diet option to help obese individuals lose weight and decrease CAD risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as UIC-004-2009.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare changes in body composition and the metabolic profile between women taking an intermittent diet (ID) and women taking a continuous diet (CD).
METHODS: Twenty-five obese postmenopausal women were randomized to an ID (n = 13) or a CD (n = 12). In the ID, 5-week energy restriction periods were followed by 5-week weight stabilization periods. In the CD, 15 weeks of energy restriction was followed by 5 weeks of weight stabilization. Outcome measures before, during, and after weight loss, as well as after a 1-year follow-up, were body weight and composition, waist circumference, resting metabolic rate, and fasting lipid and glucose levels.
RESULTS: Body weight, waist circumference, percentage fat mass, and fat mass decreased significantly and similarly in both groups (P {\textless} 0.0001). Both groups showed similar overall decreases in plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides (all P {\textless} 0.05). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol improved significantly in the CD group only, whereas fasting glucose decreased significantly in the ID group only. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and resting metabolic rate remained stable in both groups. Fasting plasma triglyceride and glucose levels were the only metabolic variables to further improve after the fifth week of the protocol. At the 1-year follow-up, both interventions were associated with successful and similar weight loss maintenance and improvements in fasting plasma glucose levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The ID resulted in similar short- and long-term changes in body composition and metabolic profile compared with a CD. Most improvements occurred during the first 5 weeks of treatment in both interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During the month of Ramadan, Moslems refrain from drinking and eating between sunrise and sunset. This review aimed to analyze the effects of Ramadan fasting on physiological and behavioral variables in healthy subjects.
METHODS: Articles included in this paper were taken from Medline, three international congresses on health and Ramadan, and in several cases from local journals.
RESULTS: Ramadan fasting did not dramatically affect the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins, or the daily mean of hormonal serum levels. An increase in serum urea and uric acid was frequently reported and this could be attributed to dehydration during this month. Some changes, such as the increase of HDL and apoprotein A1, and the decrease in LDL, could be beneficial for the cardiovascular system. However, the chronobiological studies have shown that Ramadan fasting affects the circadian distribution of body temperature, cortisol, melatonin and glycemia. The amplitude of most of these rhythms decreased and the acrophase shifted. Nocturnal sleep, daytime alertness and psychomotor performance were decreased.
CONCLUSION: The major changes during Ramadan fasting are chronobiological and behavioral. They could be responsible for the high incidence of road traffic accidents and the reduction of working hours during the month of Ramadan.},

In the present study, we examined the ability of modified ADF, with a low-fat (LF) vs high-fat (HF) background diet, to modulate adipose tissue physiology in a way that may protect against coronary heart disease. In a 4-week study, male C57BL/6 mice were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) ADF-85\%-LF (85\% energy restriction on fast day, ad libitum fed on feed day, on an LF diet), (2) ADF-85\%-HF (same protocol but HF diet), and (3) control (ad libitum fed). Throughout the study, body weight did not differ between ADF and control animals. Proportion of subcutaneous fat increased (P {\textless} .01), whereas the proportion of visceral fat decreased (P {\textless} .01), in both ADF groups. Triglyceride (TG) synthesis was augmented (P {\textless} .05) in subcutaneous fat, but remained unchanged in visceral fat. Adiponectin concentrations were elevated (P {\textless} .05), whereas leptin and resistin levels decreased (P {\textless} .05). Aortic vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation was reduced (P {\textless} .05) by 60\% and 76\% on the LF and HF diets, respectively. Plasma total cholesterol, TG, and free fatty acid concentrations also decreased (P {\textless} .05). In summary, modified ADF regimens alter adipose tissue physiology (ie, body fat distribution, TG metabolism, and adipokines) in a way that may protect against coronary heart disease. These beneficial effects were noted over a wide range of fat intake, suggesting that ADF may be protective even in the presence of HF diets.},

It was hypothesized that intermittent prolonged fasting practiced during the month of Ramadan (RIF) could positively affect the inflammatory state. To investigate this hypothesis, a cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the impact of RIF on selected inflammatory cytokines and immune biomarkers in healthy subjects. Fifty (21 men and 29 women) healthy volunteers who practiced Ramadan fasting were recruited for the investigation of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α), immune cells (total leukocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes), and anthropometric and dietary assessments. The investigations were conducted 1 week before Ramadan fasting, at the end of the third week of Ramadan, and 1 month after the cessation of Ramadan month. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α; systolic and diastolic blood pressures; body weight; and body fat percentage were significantly lower (P {\textless} .05) during Ramadan as compared with before Ramadan or after the cessation of Ramadan fasting. Immune cells significantly decreased during Ramadan but still remained within the reference ranges. These results indicate that RIF attenuates inflammatory status of the body by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine expression and decreasing body fat and circulating levels of leukocytes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intermittent fasting (IF) was shown to increase whole-body insulin sensitivity, but it is uncertain whether IF selectively influences intermediary metabolism. Such selectivity might be advantageous when adapting to periods of food abundance and food shortage.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess effects of IF on intermediary metabolism and energy expenditure.
DESIGN: Glucose, glycerol, and valine fluxes were measured after 2 wk of IF and a standard diet (SD) in 8 lean healthy volunteers in a crossover design, in the basal state and during a 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, with assessment of energy expenditure and phosphorylation of muscle protein kinase B (AKT), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK), and mammalian target of rapamycine (mTOR). We hypothesized that IF selectively increases peripheral glucose uptake and lowers proteolysis, thereby protecting protein stores.
RESULTS: No differences in body weight were observed between the IF and SD groups. Peripheral glucose uptake and hepatic insulin sensitivity during the clamp did not significantly differ between the IF and SD groups. Likewise, lipolysis and proteolysis were not different between the IF and SD groups. IF decreased resting energy expenditure. IF had no effect on the phosphorylation of AKT but significantly increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase. Phosphorylation of mTOR was significantly lower after IF than after the SD.
CONCLUSIONS: IF does not affect whole-body glucose, lipid, or protein metabolism in healthy lean men despite changes in muscle phosphorylation of GSK and mTOR. The decrease in resting energy expenditure after IF indicates the possibility of an increase in weight during IF when caloric intake is not adjusted.

Nevertheless, intermittent fasting resulted in beneficial effects that met or exceeded those of caloric restriction including reduced serum glucose and insulin levels and increased resistance of neurons in the brain to excitotoxic stress. Intermittent fasting therefore has beneficial effects on glucose regulation and neuronal resistance to injury in these mice that are independent of caloric intake.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intermittent fasting (IF; severe restriction 1 d/week) facilitates weight loss and improves coronary heart disease (CHD) risk indicators. The degree to which weight loss can be enhanced if IF is combined with calorie restriction (CR) and liquid meals, remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of IF plus CR (with or without a liquid diet) on body weight, body composition, and CHD risk.
METHODS: Obese women (n = 54) were randomized to either the IFCR-liquid (IFCR-L) or IFCR-food based (IFCR-F) diet. The trial had two phases: 1) 2-week weight maintenance period, and 2) 8-week weight loss period.
RESULTS: Body weight decreased more (P = 0.04) in the IFCR-L group (3.9 ± 1.4 kg) versus the IFCR-F group (2.5 ± 0.6 kg). Fat mass decreased similarly (P {\textless} 0.0001) in the IFCR-L and IFCR-F groups (2.8 ± 1.2 kg and 1.9 ± 0.7 kg, respectively). Visceral fat was reduced (P {\textless} 0.001) by IFCR-L (0.7 ± 0.5 kg) and IFCR-F (0.3 ± 0.5 kg) diets. Reductions in total and LDL cholesterol levels were greater (P = 0.04) in the IFCR-L (19 ± 10\%; 20 ± 9\%, respectively) versus the IFCR-F group (8 ± 3\%; 7 ± 4\%, respectively). LDL peak particle size increased (P {\textless} 0.01), while heart rate, glucose, insulin, and homocysteine decreased (P {\textless} 0.05), in the IFCR-L group only.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IF combined with CR and liquid meals is an effective strategy to help obese women lose weight and lower CHD risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well known that nutritional habits, sleeping patterns and meal frequency have profound effects on maintaining human health. Ramadan is a religious month for Islam, during which Muslims do not eat and drink during the daylight hours. The duration of restricted food and beverage intake is approximately 12 h/day for 1 month, which makes Ramadan a model of prolonged intermittent fasting.
METHODS: In order to evaluate the effects of long-lasting modifications of food intake on inflammatory markers and biochemical parameters 40 healthy volunteers of normal weight [20 females aged between 20 and 38 years, 20 males aged between 23 and 39 years, body mass index (BMI) {\textless}25 kg/m(2)] who fasted during Ramadan and another 28 healthy age- and BMI-matched volunteers (14 males, 14 females) who did not fast participated in the study. Venous blood samples were taken 1 week before Ramadan, during the last week of Ramadan and 3 weeks after Ramadan. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine, vitamin B(12), folate, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were measured.
RESULTS: No significant changes were observed in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels. TC/HDL ratio (HDL risk factor) was decreased during and after Ramadan in both genders in the fasting group while there were no changes in the nonfasting group. IL-6 (p {\textless} 0.001), CRP (p {\textless} 0.001) and homocysteine (p {\textless} 0.01) levels were significantly low during Ramadan in the fasting subjects of both genders when compared to basal values (1 week before Ramadan).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that prolonged intermittent fasting in a model like Ramadan has some positive effects on the inflammatory status of the body and on the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as homocysteine, CRP and TC/HDL ratio.},

	abstract = {Aging is associated with a host of biological changes that contribute to a progressive decline in cognitive and physical function, ultimately leading to a loss of independence, and increased risk of mortality. To date, prolonged caloric restriction (i.e., a reduction in caloric intake without malnutrition) is the only non-genetic intervention that has consistently been found to extend both mean and maximal life span across a variety of species. Most individuals have difficulty sustaining prolonged caloric restriction, which has led to a search for alternative approaches that can produce similar to benefits as caloric restriction. A growing body of evidence indicates that fasting periods and intermittent fasting regimens in particular can trigger similar biological pathways as caloric restriction. For this reason, there is increasing scientific interest in further exploring the biological and metabolic effects of intermittent fasting periods, as well as whether long-term compliance may be improved by this type of dietary approach. This special will highlight the latest scientific findings related to the effects of both caloric restriction and intermittent fasting across various species including yeast, fruit flies, worms, rodents, primates, and humans. A specific emphasis is placed on translational research with findings from basic bench to bedside reviewed and practical clinical implications discussed.},

Recovery of immune and antioxidant systems is important but less well documented. In some cases, there is little effective recovery until nutrients are supplied, while in others, the stimulus for recovery is strongest in the period immediately after exercise. Lack of appropriate nutritional support will reduce adaption to exercise and impair preparation for future bouts. Ramadan represents a special case of intermittent fasting undertaken by many athletes during periods of training as well as important competitive events. The avoidance of fluid and food intake from sunrise to sundown involves prolonged periods without intake of nutrients, inflexibility with the timing of eating and drinking over the day and around an exercise session, and changes to usual dietary choices due to the special foods involved with various rituals. These outcomes will all challenge the athlete's ability to recover optimally between exercise sessions undertaken during the fast or from day to day.},

	abstract = {Adult humans often undertake acute fasts for cosmetic, religious or medical reasons. For example, an estimated 14\% of US adults have reported using fasting as a means to control body weight and this approach has long been advocated as an intermittent treatment for gross refractory obesity. There are unique historical data sets on extreme forms of food restriction that give insight into the consequences of starvation or semi-starvation in previously healthy, but usually non-obese subjects. These include documented medical reports on victims of hunger strike, famine and prisoners of war. Such data provide a detailed account on how the body adapts to prolonged starvation. It has previously been shown that fasting for the biblical period of 40 days and 40 nights is well within the overall physiological capabilities of a healthy adult. However, the specific effects on the human body and mind are less clearly documented, either in the short term (hours) or in the longer term (days). This review asks the following three questions, pertinent to any weight-loss therapy, (i) how effective is the regime in achieving weight loss, (ii) what impact does it have on psychology? and finally, (iii) does it work long-term?},

	abstract = {Background:Alternate day fasting (ADF) with a low-fat (LF) diet improves brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Whether these beneficial effects can be reproduced with a high-fat (HF) diet remains unclear.Objective:This study compared the effects of ADF-HF to ADF-LF regimens on FMD. The role that adipokines have in mediating this effect was also investigated.Methods:Thirty-two obese subjects were randomized to an ADF-HF (45\% fat) or ADF-LF diet (25\% fat), consisting of two phases: (1) a 2-week baseline weight maintenance period and (2) an 8-week ADF weight loss period. Food was provided throughout the study.Results:Body weight was reduced (P{\textless}0.0001) in the ADF-HF (4.4±1.0 kg) and ADF-LF group (3.7±0.7 kg). FMD decreased (P{\textless}0.05) by ADF-HF relative to baseline (7±1 to 5±2\%) and increased (P{\textless}0.05) by ADF-LF (5±1 to 7±2\%). Blood pressure remained unchanged in both groups. Adiponectin increased (P{\textless}0.05) in the ADF-HF (43±7\%) and ADF-LF group (51±7\%). Leptin and resistin decreased (P{\textless}0.05) in the ADF-HF (32±5\%; 23±5\%) and ADF-LF group (30±3\%; 27±4\%). Increases in adiponectin were associated with augmented FMD in the ADF-LF group only (r=0.34, P=0.03).Conclusion:Thus, improvements in FMD with ADF may only occur with LF diets and not with HF diets, and adipokines may not have a significant role in mediating this effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During Ramadan, Muslims fast during the daylight hours for a month. The duration of restricted food and beverage intake is approximately 12 h/day which makes Ramadan a unique model of intermittent fasting. Many physiological and psychological changes are observed during Ramadan that are probably due to the changes in eating and sleeping patterns.
METHODS: Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), plasma fibrinogen, D-dimer and homocysteine levels were measured in 24 healthy fasting volunteers (12 females, 12 males) aged 21-35 years. Venous blood samples were taken 1 week before Ramadan, on the 21st day of Ramadan and 20 days after Ramadan.
RESULTS: No significant changes were observed on serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels. HDL levels were significantly elevated during Ramadan (p {\textless} 0.001) and 20 days after Ramadan (p {\textless} 0.05). Prothrombin time, aPTT, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were in the physiologic limits in all samples but D-dimer levels were significantly low at the end of Ramadan in comparison to pre- and post-fasting levels (p {\textless} 0.001). Homocysteine levels, being still in reference ranges, were low during Ramadan (p {\textless} 0.05) and reached the pre-fasting levels after Ramadan.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that intermittent fasting led to some beneficial changes in serum HDL and plasma homocysteine levels, and the coagulation status. These changes may be due to omitting at least one meal when the body was particularly metabolically active and possibly had a low blood viscosity level at the same time. We conclude that intermittent fasting may have beneficial effects on hemostatic risk markers for cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Insulin resistance is currently a major health problem. This may be because of a marked decrease in daily physical activity during recent decades combined with constant food abundance. This lifestyle collides with our genome, which was most likely selected in the late Paleolithic era (50,000-10,000 BC) by criteria that favored survival in an environment characterized by fluctuations between periods of feast and famine. The theory of thrifty genes states that these fluctuations are required for optimal metabolic function. We mimicked the fluctuations in eight healthy young men [25.0 +/- 0.1 yr (mean +/- SE); body mass index: 25.7 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2)] by subjecting them to intermittent fasting every second day for 20 h for 15 days. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (40 mU.min(-1).m(-2)) clamps were performed before and after the intervention period. Subjects maintained body weight (86.4 +/- 2.3 kg; coefficient of variation: 0.8 +/- 0.1\%). Plasma free fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were 347 +/- 18 and 0.06 +/- 0.02 mM, respectively, after overnight fast but increased (P {\textless} 0.05) to 423 +/- 86 and 0.10 +/- 0.04 mM after 20-h fasting, confirming that the subjects were fasting. Insulin-mediated whole body glucose uptake rates increased from 6.3 +/- 0.6 to 7.3 +/- 0.3 mg.kg(-1).min(-1) (P = 0.03), and insulin-induced inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis was more prominent after than before the intervention (P = 0.05). After the 20-h fasting periods, plasma adiponectin was increased compared with the basal levels before and after the intervention (5,922 +/- 991 vs. 3,860 +/- 784 ng/ml, P = 0.02). This experiment is the first in humans to show that intermittent fasting increases insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates, and the findings are compatible with the thrifty gene concept.},

METHODS: Body weight, height, waist and hip circumferences were measured, body mass index (BMI) was calculated and fat mass, fat-free mass and percentage body fat were assessed by bioelectrical impedance on 240 adult subjects (male: 158) who fasted between sunrise and sunset for at least 20 days. Measurements were taken 1 week before and 1 week after Ramadan. Energy and macronutrient intakes were assessed using a 3-day food frequency questionnaire on a sub-sample of subjects before and during Ramadan.
RESULTS: Subjects were grouped according to age and sex: ≤35 years (n = 82, males: 31) and 36-70 years (n = 158, males: 127). There were significant reductions in weight and BMI (P {\textless} 0.001) in almost all subjects, with the biggest being in males ≤35 years [-2.2\% (SE 2.2\%), P {\textless} 0.001]. Waist and hip circumferences fell in most subjects, except females aged 36-70 years. Fat mass fell in most subjects, ranging from 2.3\% to 4.3\% from baseline, except in females aged 36-70 years who did not experience a significant change. Fat-free mass was significantly reduced in all subjects (P {\textless} 0.001), whereas percentage body fat was lower only in males by 2.5\% (SE 3.2\%) (P = 0.029) in those aged ≤35 years and by 1.1\% (SE 1.5\%) (P {\textless} 0.001) in those aged 36-70 years. Dietary intake was similar before and during Ramadan, except in males whose protein intake fell during Ramadan (P = 0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: Ramadan fasting leads to weight loss and fat-free mass reductions. Body composition changes vary depending on age and sex.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the dietary and physical activity adaptations that occur during short-term ADMF, and to determine how these modulations affect rate of weight loss.
METHODS: Sixteen obese subjects (12 women/4 men) completed a 10-week trial consisting of 3 phases: 1) 2-week control phase, 2) 4-week ADMF controlled feeding phase, and 3) 4-week ADMF self-selected feeding phase.
RESULTS: Body weight decreased (P {\textless} 0.001) by 5.6 ± 1.0 kg post-treatment. Energy intake on the fast day was 26 ± 3\% of baseline needs (501 ± 28 kcal/d). No hyperphagic response occurred on the feed day (95 ± 6\% of baseline needs consumed, 1801 ± 226 kcal/d). Daily energy restriction (37 ± 7\%) was correlated to rate of weight loss (r = 0.42, P = 0.01). Dietary fat intake decreased (36\% to 33\% of kcal, P {\textless} 0.05) with dietary counseling, and was related to rate of weight loss (r = 0.38, P = 0.03). Hunger on the fast day decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) by week 2, and remained low. Habitual physical activity was maintained throughout the study (fast day: 6416 ± 851 steps/d; feed day: 6569 ± 910 steps/d).
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that obese subjects quickly adapt to ADMF, and that changes in energy/macronutrient intake, hunger, and maintenance of physical activity play a role in influencing rate of weight loss by ADMF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with an atherogenic lipid profile characterized by a predominance of small LDL and HDL particles. Weight loss, by dietary restriction or exercise, increases LDL particle size. Whether these interventions can augment HDL size in conjunction with LDL size remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of alternate day fasting (ADF), calorie restriction (CR), and endurance exercise on LDL and HDL particle size in overweight and obese subjects.
METHODS: In a 12-week parallel-arm trial, adult subjects (n = 60) were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: 1) ADF (75\% energy restriction for 24-h alternated with ad libitum feeding for 24-h), 2) CR (25\% energy restriction every day), 3) exercise (moderate intensity training 3 x/week), or 4) control.
RESULTS: Body weight was reduced (P {\textless} 0.001) by ADF, CR, and exercise (5.2 ± 1.1\%, 5.0 ± 1.4\%, 5.1 ± 0.9\%, respectively). Plasma LDL cholesterol decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) with ADF (10 ± 4\%) and CR (8 ± 4\%), whereas HDL cholesterol increased (P {\textless} 0.05) with exercise (16 ± 5\%). Integrated LDL particle size was augmented (P = 0.01) by ADF and CR. The proportion of small LDL particles decreased (P = 0.04) with ADF only, and the proportion of large HDL particles increased (P = 0.03) with exercise only.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that dietary restriction increases LDL particle size, while endurance training augments HDL particle size, with minimal weight loss. None of these interventions concomitantly increased both LDL and HDL particle size, however.},

In this review article we describe evidence suggesting that two dietary interventions, caloric restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF), can prolong the health-span of the nervous system by impinging upon fundamental metabolic and cellular signaling pathways that regulate life-span. CR and IF affect energy and oxygen radical metabolism, and cellular stress response systems, in ways that protect neurons against genetic and environmental factors to which they would otherwise succumb during aging. There are multiple interactive pathways and molecular mechanisms by which CR and IF benefit neurons including those involving insulin-like signaling, FoxO transcription factors, sirtuins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. These pathways stimulate the production of protein chaperones, neurotrophic factors and antioxidant enzymes, all of which help cells cope with stress and resist disease. A better understanding of the impact of CR and IF on the aging nervous system will likely lead to novel approaches for preventing and treating neurodegenerative disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged dietary restriction increases the life span in rodents. Some evidence suggests that alternate-day fasting may also prolong the life span.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine whether alternate-day fasting is a feasible method of dietary restriction in nonobese humans and whether it improves known biomarkers of longevity.
DESIGN: Nonobese subjects (8 men and 8 women) fasted every other day for 22 d. Body weight, body composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), respiratory quotient (RQ), temperature, fasting serum glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, and ghrelin were assessed at baseline and after 21 d (12-h fast) and 22 d (36-h fast) of alternate-day fasting. Visual analogue scales were used to assess hunger weekly.
RESULTS: Subjects lost 2.5 +/- 0.5\% of their initial body weight (P {\textless} 0.001) and 4 +/- 1\% of their initial fat mass (P {\textless} 0.001). Hunger increased on the first day of fasting and remained elevated (P {\textless} 0.001). RMR and RQ did not change significantly from baseline to day 21, but RQ decreased on day 22 (P {\textless} 0.001), which resulted in an average daily increase in fat oxidation of {\textgreater} or =15 g. Glucose and ghrelin did not change significantly from baseline with alternate-day fasting, whereas fasting insulin decreased 57 +/- 4\% (P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Alternate-day fasting was feasible in nonobese subjects, and fat oxidation increased. However, hunger on fasting days did not decrease, perhaps indicating the unlikelihood of continuing this diet for extended periods of time. Adding one small meal on a fasting day may make this approach to dietary restriction more acceptable.},

	abstract = {Alternate day fasting (ADF) with a low-fat (LF) diet is effective for weight loss and cardio-protection. However, the applicability of these findings is questionable as the majority of Americans consume a high-fat (HF) diet.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine if these beneficial changes in body weight and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk can be reproduced if an HF background diet is used in place of an LF diet during ADF.
METHODS: Thirty-two obese subjects were randomized to an ADF-HF (45\% fat) or ADF-LF diet (25\% fat), which consisted of two phases: 1) a 2-week baseline weight maintenance period, and 2) an 8-week ADF weight loss period. All food was provided during the study.
RESULTS: Body weight was reduced (P{\textless}0.0001) by ADF-HF (4.8\%±1.1\%) and by ADF-LF (4.2\%±0.8\%). Fat mass decreased (P{\textless}0.0001) by ADF-HF (5.4±1.5 kg) and ADF-LF (4.2±0.6 kg). Fat free mass remained unchanged. Waist circumference decreased (P{\textless}0.001) by ADF-HF (7.2±1.5 cm) and ADF-LF (7.3±0.9 cm). LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations were reduced (P{\textless}0.001) by both interventions (ADF-HF: 18.3\%±4.6\%, 13.7\%±4.8\%; and ADF-LF: 24.8\%±2.6\%, 14.3\%±4.4\%). HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate remained unchanged. There were no between-group differences for any parameter.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an ADF-HF diet is equally as effective as an ADF-LF diet in helping obese subjects lose weight and improve CHD risk factors.},

	abstract = {Hormesis is defined as a dose-response phenomenon characterized by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, and has been recognized as representing an overcompensation for mild environmental stress. The beneficial effects of mild stress on aging and longevity have been studied for many years. In experimental animals, mild dietary stress (dietary restriction, DR) without malnutrition delays most age-related physiological changes, and extends maximum and average lifespan. Animal studies have also demonstrated that DR can prevent or lessen the severity of cancer, stroke, coronary heart disease, autoimmune disease, allergy, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The effects of DR are considered to result from hormetic mechanisms. These effects were reported by means of various DR regimens, such as caloric restriction, total-nutrient restriction, alternate-day fasting, and short-term fasting. Mild dietary stress, including restriction of amount or frequency of intake, is the essence of DR. For more than 99\% of their history, humans lived as hunter-gatherers and adapted to restrictions in their food supply. On the other hand, an oversufficiency of food for many today has resulted in the current global epidemic of obesity and obesity-related diseases. DR may be used, therefore, as a novel approach for therapeutic intervention in several diseases, when detailed information about effects of mild dietary stress on human health is obtained from clinical trials.

	abstract = {Dietary restriction is an effective strategy for weight loss in obese individuals. The most common form of dietary restriction implemented is daily calorie restriction (CR), which involves reducing energy by 15-60\% of usual caloric intake every day. Another form of dietary restriction employed is intermittent CR, which involves 24 h of ad libitum food consumption alternated with 24 h of complete or partial food restriction. Although both diets are effective for weight loss, it remains unknown whether one of these interventions produces superior changes in body weight and body composition when compared to the other. Accordingly, this review examines the effects of daily CR versus intermittent CR on weight loss, fat mass loss and lean mass retention in overweight and obese adults. Results reveal similar weight loss and fat mass loss with 3 to 12 weeks' intermittent CR (4-8\%, 11-16\%, respectively) and daily CR (5-8\%, 10-20\%, respectively). In contrast, less fat free mass was lost in response to intermittent CR versus daily CR. These findings suggest that these diets are equally as effective in decreasing body weight and fat mass, although intermittent CR may be more effective for the retention of lean mass.},

	abstract = {Background: Although consumption of 3 meals/d is the most common pattern of eating in industrialized countries, a scientific rationale for this meal frequency with respect to optimal health is lacking. A diet with less meal frequency can improve the health and extend the lifespan of laboratory animals, but its effect on humans has never been tested. Objective: A pilot study was conducted to establish the effects of a reduced-meal-frequency diet on health indicators in healthy, normal-weight adults. Design: The study was a randomized crossover design with two 8-wk treatment periods. During the treatment periods, subjects consumed all of the calories needed for weight maintenance in either 3 meals/d or 1 meal/d. Results: Subjects who completed the study maintained their body weight within 2 kg of their initial weight throughout the 6-mo period. There were no significant effects of meal frequency on heart rate, body temperature, or most of the blood variables measured. However, when consuming I meal/d, subjects had a significant increase in hunger; a significant modification of body composition, including reductions in fat mass; significant increases in blood pressure and in total, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations; and a significant decrease in concentrations of cortisol. Conclusions: Normal-weight subjects are able to comply with a I meal/d diet. When meal frequency is decreased without a reduction in overall calorie intake, modest changes occur in body composition, some cardiovascular disease risk factors, and hematologic variables.

The main effect of CR on both asexual modes was to delay death at young ages, rather than to prevent death at middle ages or to greatly extend maximum life span; in contrast CR in sexual females greatly increased the life span of a few long-lived individuals. Lifetime fecundity did not decrease with CCR, suggesting a lack of resource allocation trade-off between somatic maintenance and reproduction. Multiple outcomes for a clonal lineage indicate that different responses are established through epigenetic programming, whereas differences in life-span allocations suggest that multiple genetic mechanisms mediate life-span extension.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a worldwide health problem with increasing prevalence. Decrease in energy intake has been shown to lower the risk of coronary artery disease in obese subjects. The common form of dietary restriction is daily calorie restriction (CR). Another form is alternate-day fasting (ADF). This study examined the ability of modified ADF to facilitate weight loss and lower cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese women.
METHODS: 15 adult subjects completed an 8 weeks trial (2 weeks observed and 6 weeks ADF). All women consumed very low calorie diet on the fast day and usually diet in every other day. Body weight (BW), fat mass and blood pressure (BP) were measured. Fasting blood samples were collected at the first and 57th day of trial for biochemical analysis.
RESULTS: During the course of the trial, BW of the subjects decreased (p {\textless} 0/0001) from 84/3 ± 11/44 kg to 78/3 ± 10/18 kg. Waist Circumference decreased from 87/87 ± 9/74 to 82/86 ± 9/68(p {\textless} 0/001). Reduction in systolic BP was seen from 114.8 ± 9.16 to 105.13 ± 10.19 mmHg (p {\textless} 0/001) and diastolic BP changed from 82.86 ± 10.6 to 74.5 ± 10.8 (P {\textless} 0.05). Total cholesterol decreased from 227/73 ± 49/96 to 214/67 ± 43/27, TG from 160/5 ± 46/18 to 143/9 ± 22/77, LDL from 149/46 ± 49/81 to 131/3 ± 50/97, and FBS from 102 ± 14/7 to 96 ± 11/79 mg/dl but were not significant. HDL increased from 42/32 ± 18/01 to 50/58 ± 19/46 and was not significant.
CONCLUSION: These finding suggest that short time ADF is a viable dietary option to help obese individuals lose weight and decrease some CAD risk factors. More and longer-term studies in human subjects are needed to support this important result.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a combination weight loss program using intermittent low-calorie diets, energy-controlled meal replacement products, and sibutramine on weight loss, diabetes control, and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight or obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with diet or oral medication were randomly assigned to either a standard therapy or combination therapy group. Both groups received a standardized program to facilitate weight loss. The combination therapy group also received 10-15 mg sibutramine daily, low-calorie diets using meal replacement products for 1 week every 2 months, and between low-calorie diet weeks, once daily use of meal replacement product and snack bars to replace one usual meal and snack. Primary outcome measures were changes in body weight, glycemic control, plasma lipids, blood pressure, pulse, and body composition at 1 year.
RESULTS: At 1 year, combination therapy, compared with standard therapy, resulted in significantly more weight loss (-7.3 +/- 1.3 kg vs. -0.8 +/- 0.9 kg, P {\textless} 0.001) and reduction in HbA(1c) (-0.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.0 +/- 0.2\%, P = 0.05). Combination therapy resulted in reduced requirement for diabetes medications and decreased fat mass and lean body mass. A 5-kg decrease in weight at 1 year was associated with a decrease of 0.4\% in HbA(1c) (P = 0.006). Changes in fasting glucose, lipids, pulse, and blood pressure did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This combination weight loss program resulted in greater weight loss and improved diabetes control compared with a standard weight loss program in overweight or obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Energy restriction (ER) to control weight is a potential strategy for breast cancer prevention. The protective effects of habitual continuous energy restriction (CER) and weight loss on breast tumour formation have been conclusively demonstrated in animal studies over the past 100 years, and more recently in women using data from observational studies and bariatric surgery. Intermittent energy restriction (IER) and intermittent fasting (IF) are possible alternative preventative approaches which may be easier for individuals to undertake and possibly more effective than standard CER. Here, we summarise the available data on CER, IER and IF with special emphasis on their potential for breast cancer prevention. In animals, IER is superior or equivalent to CER with the exception of carcinogen-induced tumour models when initiated soon after carcinogen exposure. There are no human data on IER and breast cancer risk, but three studies demonstrated IER and CER to be equivalent for weight loss. IF regimens also reduce mammary tumour formation in animal models and also led to weight loss in human subjects, but have not been directly compared with CER. Animal and some human data suggest that both IER and IF may differ mechanistically compared with CER and may bring about greater reduction in hepatic and visceral fat stores, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and cell proliferation, and increased insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. Although IER and IF were first studied 65 years ago, we conclude that further studies are required to assess their values compared with CER.},

The gut microbiota shapes immune responses during human life and affects his/her metabolomic profiles. Furthermore, many studies highlight the molecular pathways that mediate host and symbiont interactions that regulate proper immune function and prevention of cancer in the body. Intriguingly, if cancer forms in a human body due to the weakness of immune system in detriment of microbiome, the removal of cancer stem cells can be carried out through early Calories Restriction with Annual Fasting (AF) before tumor development or progress. Besides, fasting can balance the gut microbiome for enhancement of immune system against cancer formation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fat-specific protein of 27 kDa (FSP27) is a novel lipid droplet protein that promotes triacylglycerol storage in white adipose tissue (WAT). The regulation of the Fsp27 gene expression in WAT is largely unknown. We investigated the nutritional regulation of FSP27 in WAT.
METHODS: The effects of intermittent fasting (48 d, eight cycles of 3-d fasting and 3-d refeeding), caloric restriction (48 d), fasting-refeeding (3-d fasting and 3-d refeeding), and fasting (3 d) on mRNA expression of FSP27, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ2), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), and M isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (a positive control for PPARγ activation) in epididymal WAT and on serum triacylglycerol, insulin, and leptin levels were determined in Wistar rats. We also determined the effects of PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or pioglitazone on FSP27 mRNA levels in primary rat adipocytes.
RESULTS: Long-term intermittent fasting, in contrast to other dietary manipulations, significantly up-regulated Fsp27 gene expression in WAT. Moreover, in rats subjected to intermittent fasting, serum insulin levels were elevated; PPARγ2 and C/EBPα mRNA expression in WAT was increased, and there was a positive correlation of Fsp27 gene expression with PPARγ2 and C/EBPα mRNA levels. FSP27 mRNA expression was also increased in adipocytes treated with PPARγ agonists.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the transcription of the Fsp27 gene in adipose tissue may be induced in response to nutritional stimuli. Furthermore, PPARγ2, C/EBPα, and insulin may be involved in the nutritional regulation of FSP27. Thus intermittent fasting, despite lower caloric intake, may promote triacylglycerol deposition in WAT by increasing the expression of genes involved in lipid storage, such as Fsp27.},

	abstract = {Stroke, a major cause of disability and mortality in the elderly, occurs when a cerebral blood vessel is occluded or ruptured, resulting in ischemic damage and death of brain cells. The injury mechanism involves metabolic and oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, apoptosis and inflammatory processes, including activation of glial cells and infiltration of leukocytes. In animal models, dietary energy restriction, by daily calorie reduction (CR) or intermittent fasting (IF), extends lifespan and decreases the development of age-related diseases. Dietary energy restriction may also benefit neurons, as suggested by experimental evidence showing that CR and IF protect neurons against degeneration in animal models. Recent findings by our group and others suggest the possibility that dietary energy restriction may protect against stroke induced brain injury, in part by inducing the expression of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF); protein chaperones, including heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78); antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SOD) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1), uncoupling proteins and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intermittent fasting (IF) improves healthy lifespan in animals by a mechanism involving reduced oxidative damage and increased resistance to stress. However, no studies have evaluated the impact of controlled meal frequency on immune responses in human subjects.
OBJECTIVE: A study was conducted to establish the effects of controlled diets with different meal frequencies, but similar daily energy intakes, on cytokine production in healthy male and female subjects.
DESIGN: In a crossover study design with an intervening washout period, healthy normal weight middle-age male and female subjects (n = 15) were maintained for 2 months on controlled on-site one meal per day (OMD) or three meals per day (TMD) isocaloric diets. Serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) culture supernatants from subjects were analyzed for the presence of inflammatory markers using a multiplex assay.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the inflammatory markers in the serum of subjects on the OMD or TMD diets. There was an increase in the capacity of PBMCs to produce cytokines in subjects during the first month on the OMD or TMD diets.Lower levels of TNF-α, IL-17, MCP-1 and MIP-1β were produced by PBMCs from subjects on the OMD versus TMD diet.
CONCLUSIONS: PBMCs of subjects on controlled diets exhibit hypersensitivities to cellular stimulation suggesting that stress associated with altered eating behavior might affect cytokine production by immune cells upon stimulation. Moreover, stimulated PBMCs derived from healthy individuals on a reduced meal frequency diet respond with a reduced capability to produce cytokines.},

RESULTS: Of 56 subjects who intended to fast, 37 (65\%) were successful. Individuals terminated their fast in the presence of either hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia and adherence to the protocol was high. There were no serious side-effects of fasting. Successful fasters had greater reductions in insulin dosage and higher HbA(1c). There were no differences between individuals taking intermittent insulin injections and those with continuous infusion pumps.
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with Type 1 diabetes can participate safely in prolonged fasts provided they reduce their usual insulin dose significantly and adhere to guidelines regarding glucose monitoring and indications for terminating fasting.},

	abstract = {The effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) was studied on a battery of blood lipid markers in 15 elite judo athletes during a period when they were maintaining their training load without competing. Nine-to-twelve hours postprandial serum lipid and lipoproteins were measured on five occasions: before, three times during Ramadan, and three weeks post-Ramadan. Dietary data were collected using a 24-hour recall method for three days before, during and after the Ramadan month. Mean energy intake (12.9 MJ/d) remained similar throughout the study as did the macronutrient constituents of the diet. Mean body mass was slightly reduced (2 \%; p {\textless} 0.01) by the end of Ramadan due mainly to a 0.65 +/- 0.68 kg decrease in body fat (p {\textless} 0.05). The RIF produced significant changes in some of the blood lipid levels: both HDL-C and LDL-C increased by 0.12 (p {\textless} 0.01) and 0.20 mmol . l (-1) (p {\textless} 0.05), respectively. During Ramadan, mean non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels decreased from 0.73 to 0.28 mmol . l (-1) (p {\textless} 0.01) during the first week, then increased (p {\textless} 0.05) to 1.22 mmol . l (-1) over the middle of Ramadan and recovered to pre-Ramadan concentrations for the end and the post-Ramadan periods. Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1) levels were significantly elevated at the end (p {\textless} 0.01) and the post-Ramadan periods (p {\textless} 0.05). Three weeks after Ramadan, blood levels of glucose, NEFA, Apo-A1, and Apo-B did not return to the values observed before Ramadan. In conclusion, the present results show that the combination of the change in diet pattern during Ramadan, along with intense exercise training, induced a significant decrease in body mass associated with a reduction in body fat and changes in some of the serum lipids and lipoproteins. Nevertheless, all the measured serum parameters remained within normal levels for young and active individuals.

METHODS: Nine trained male rugby players (age 19 +/- 2 years, height 1.78 +/- 0.74 m) were tested 3 times: before Ramadan (C), at the end of the first week (R1), and during the fourth week (R2). They performed a progressive cycle ergometer test at each visit. The work rate was increased in 6-min stages corresponding to 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60\% of W max. Substrate oxidation was evaluated by indirect calorimetry. On each occasion, substrate and plasma hormone concentrations were measured at rest and at the end of the exercise.
RESULTS: Ramadan fasting induced a significant decrease in body mass and body fat (R2 vs. C, p {\textless} 0.001). Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, GH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 did not change significantly between C and R2, either at rest or following exercise.

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the Ramadan intermittent fast (RIF) on aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance in elite judo athletes (Judokas) maintaining their usual training loads. Physical performance tests (squat jump [SJ]), countermovement jump [CMJ], 30-second repeated jump, 30-m sprint, and the multistage fitness test) and fatigue scores were measured in 15 elite Judokas on 4 occasions: before Ramadan (T1), at the beginning of Ramadan (T2), at the end of Ramadan (T3) and 3 weeks after Ramadan. Results showed that 30-m sprint performance, multistage shuttle run test, SJ, and CMJ did not change during Ramadan. However, average power during the 30-second repeated jump test was slightly lower at the end of Ramadan (22.4 +/- 2.3 W/kg; P {\textless} 0.05) than before Ramadan (23.4 +/- 2.3 W/kg). There was a minor reduction of 1.3 kg in body mass and an increase in total fatigue scores (T2, 19 +/- 5; T3, 16 +/- 4; both P {\textless} 0.05) during Ramadan in comparison with the control period (T1, 12 +/- 3). These results show that the RIF has little effect on aerobic performance and on very short duration sprinting and jumping test performance in elite Judokas. Additionally, experienced athletes can maintain both sufficient energy intake and normal training loads during the RIF. The slight reduction in the 30-second jump test may be associated with reduced central drive and body mass. Collectively, these results suggest that the RIF has little effect on the performance of experienced Judokas, but Muslim athletes who train during the RIF should carefully periodize their training load and monitor their food intake and fatigue levels to avoid performance decrements.},

Haematological markers of inflammation, hormones, and immune status were studied in 15 elite male judo athletes before, during, and after Ramadan. The RIF produced small but significant changes in inflammatory, hormonal, and immunological profiles in judo athletes. Serum C-reactive protein increased from 2.93 +/- 0.26 mg.L-1 pre-Ramadan to 4.60 +/- 0.51 mg.L-1 at the end of Ramadan. Haptoglobin and antitrypsin also significantly increased at different phases during Ramadan, whereas homocysteine and prealbumin remained relatively unchanged. Albumin decreased slightly by mid-Ramadan, then recovered. Immunoglobulin Aincreased from 1.87 +/- 0.56 g.L-1 before Ramadan to 2.49 +/- 0.75 g.L-1 at the end, and remained high 3 weeks after. There were no changes in the leucocyte cell counts throughout the study. The mean blood level of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine increased significantly during RIF. Most of these changes were within the normal ranges. These results suggest that athletes who continue to train intensely during Ramadan are liable to experience a myriad of small fluctuations in hormones, immunoglobulins, antioxidants, and inflammatory responses.},

Previous studies that have assessed psychomotor performance during Ramadan fasting have reported conflicting results. Therefore, we designed this study to objectively assess the effects of intermittent fasting during and outside Ramadan (to control for lifestyle changes) on drowsiness, blink total duration and mean reaction time (MRT) test while controlling for potential confounders.
METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers with a mean age of 25.3 ± 2.9 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 23.4 ± 3.2 kg/m2 reported to the sleep laboratory on four occasions for polysomnography (PSG) and drowsiness and psychomotor assessments as follows: 1) adaptation; 2) 4 weeks before Ramadan while performing the Islamic fasting for 1 week (baseline fasting) (BLF); 3) 1 week before Ramadan (non-fasting baseline) (BL); and 4) during the second week of Ramadan while fasting (Ramadan). OPTALERT™ was used to objectively assess daytime drowsiness using the Johns Drowsiness Scale (JDS), and blink total duration and a visual reaction time test were used to assess MRT.
RESULTS: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage was significantly lower at BLF (17.7 ± 8.1\%) and at Ramadan (18.6 ± 10.7\%) compared with BL (25.6 ± 4.8\%) (p {\textless} 0.05). There were no significant differences between JDS scores and blink total duration during the two test periods in BL, BLF and Ramadan. There were no significant changes in MRT during BL, BLF and Ramadan.
CONCLUSIONS: Under controlled conditions of fixed light/dark exposure, caloric intake, sleep/wake schedule and sleep quality, the Islamic intermittent fasting has no impact on drowsiness and vigilance as measured by the JDS, total blink duration and MRT.},

Therefore, we designed this study to objectively assess the effects of Islamic intermittent fasting on sleep architecture and daytime sleepiness. Eight healthy volunteers reported to the Sleep Disorders Centre on five occasions for polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests: (1) during adaptation; (2) 3 weeks before Ramadan, after having performed Islamic fasting for 1 week (baseline fasting); (3) 1 week before Ramadan (non-fasting baseline); (4) 2 weeks into Ramadan (Ramadan); and (5) 2 weeks after Ramadan (non-fasting; Recovery). Daytime sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the multiple sleep latency test. The participants had a mean age of 26.6 ± 4.9 years, a body mass index of 23.7 ± 3.5 kg m(-2) and an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 7.3 ± 2.7. There was no change in weight or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale in the four study periods. The rapid eye movement sleep percentage was significantly lower during fasting. There was no difference in sleep latency, non-rapid eye movement sleep percentage, arousal index and sleep efficiency. The multiple sleep latency test analysis revealed no difference in the sleep latency between the 'non-fasting baseline', 'baseline fasting', 'Ramadan' and 'Recovery' time points. Under conditions of a fixed sleep-wake schedule and a fixed caloric intake, Islamic intermittent fasting results in decreased rapid eye movement sleep with no impact on other sleep stages, the arousal index or daytime sleepiness.},

By using data from the third wave of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (2000), we compared the body mass indices (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) of Muslims who had been in utero during Ramadan with those of Muslims who had not been in utero during Ramadan. Adult Muslims who had been in utero during Ramadan were slightly thinner than Muslims who had not been in utero during Ramadan (adjusted adult body mass index: -0.32, 95\% confidence interval: -0.57, -0.06). Those who were conceived during Ramadan also had smaller stature, being on average 0.80 cm shorter than those who were not exposed to Ramadan prenatally. Among non-Muslims, no such associations were found. This study suggests that exposure to Ramadan during pregnancy may have lasting consequences for adult body size of the offspring.},

Eleven RA men (VO2max 55 ± 7 mL·min(-1)·kg(-1)) and 10 ET men (VO₂max 68 ± 7 mL·min(-1)·kg(-1)) followed a controlled diet and refrained from volitional exercise for 8 days.

Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and creatine kinase (CK) were measured. Exercise increased the concentrations of all cytokines and CK, but there were no significant differences between groups. IL-1β increased (2.2-2.5-fold, P {\textless} 0.001) during exercise, while TNF-α was increased (1.6-2.0-fold, P {\textless} 0.001) during exercise and for 2 h post-exercise. IL-6 (71-84-fold, P {\textless} 0.001) and IL-1ra (52-64-fold, P {\textless} 0.001) were increased throughout exercise and up to FU1, peaking immediately after exercise and at 1.5-2 h post-exercise, respectively. CK concentrations were increased (P {\textless} 0.001) throughout exercise and up to FU4, peaking at FU1, but were not associated with changes in any cytokines. Exhaustive running resulted in modest and transient increases in TNF-α and IL-1β, and more marked and prolonged increases in IL-6 and IL-1ra, but improved training status did not affect this response. Increased CK might indicate either exercise-induced muscle cell disruption or increased cell permeability, although neither appears to have contributed to the increased cytokine concentrations.},

The study was designed to elucidate the impact of RIF on oxidative stress measured by 15-F(2t)-Isoprostane (15FIP). Fifty healthy subjects (23 men and 27 women) who intended to fast Ramadan were recruited. Urine and serum sampling and anthropometric and dietary assessments were conducted one week before Ramadan (T0), at the end of the third week of Ramadan (T1), and one month after Ramadan (T2). Biochemical measurements included urinary 15FIP, creatinine, and hematological indices. Results revealed that the urinary level of 15FIP measured at T0 was normal, while they showed a significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher level when measured at T1 concomitant with a significant (P {\textless} 0.05) increase in the body weight and total body fat percent. In conclusion, results suggest that increased body weight is associated with increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, and the impact of RIF on oxidative stress is mediated by the changes in body weight at the end of the month.},

This preliminary investigation compared indicators of exercise-induced muscle damage between upper-body untrained participants (N=29, 22yrs old (SD=3.34), 12 women) who completed 8h water-only fasts or ate a controlled diet in the 8h prior to five consecutive laboratory sessions. All sessions were conducted in the afternoon hours (i.e., post meridiem) and the women completed the first session while in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycles. Measures of muscle pain, resting elbow extension, upper arm girth, isometric strength, myoglobin (Mb), total nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 1beta (IL1b), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) were collected before and after eccentric contractions of the non-dominant elbow flexors were completed. The fasting group's loss of elbow extension was less than the post-prandial group (p{\textless}.05, eta(2)=.10), but the groups did not change differently across time for any other outcome measures. However, significantly higher NO (p{\textless}.05, eta(2)=.22) and lower TNFa (p{\textless}.001, eta(2)=.53) were detected in the fasting group than the post-prandial group regardless of time. These results suggest intermittent fasting does not robustly inhibit the signs and symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage, but such fasting may generally affect common indirect markers of muscle damage.},

	abstract = {Although all cells in the body require energy to survive and function properly, excessive calorie intake over long time periods can compromise cell function and promote disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and cancers. Accordingly, dietary restriction (DR; either caloric restriction or intermittent fasting, with maintained vitamin and mineral intake) can extend lifespan and can increase disease resistance. Recent studies have shown that DR can have profound effects on brain function and vulnerability to injury and disease. DR can protect neurons against degeneration in animal models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and stroke. Moreover, DR can stimulate the production of new neurons from stem cells (neurogenesis) and can enhance synaptic plasticity, which may increase the ability of the brain to resist aging and restore function following injury. Interestingly, increasing the time interval between meals can have beneficial effects on the brain and overall health of mice that are independent of cumulative calorie intake. The beneficial effects of DR, particularly those of intermittent fasting, appear to be the result of a cellular stress response that stimulates the production of proteins that enhance neuronal plasticity and resistance to oxidative and metabolic insults; they include neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protein chaperones such as heat-shock proteins, and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. Some beneficial effects of DR can be achieved by administering hormones that suppress appetite (leptin and ciliary neurotrophic factor) or by supplementing the diet with 2-deoxy-d-glucose, which may act as a calorie restriction mimetic. The profound influences of the quantity and timing of food intake on neuronal function and vulnerability to disease have revealed novel molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby diet affects the nervous system, and are leading to novel preventative and therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders.},

On the other hand, the influence of meal frequency on human health and longevity is unclear. Both caloric (energy) restriction (CR) and reduced meal frequency/intermittent fasting can suppress the development of various diseases and can increase life span in rodents by mechanisms involving reduced oxidative damage and increased stress resistance. Many of the beneficial effects of CR and fasting appear to be mediated by the nervous system. For example, intermittent fasting results in increased production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which increases the resistance of neurons in the brain to dysfunction and degeneration in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders; BDNF signaling may also mediate beneficial effects of intermittent fasting on glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. A better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms by which meal size and frequency affect human health may lead to novel approaches for disease prevention and treatment.},

Unsurprisingly, therefore, all animals exhibit adaptive biochemical and physiological responses to the lack of food. Many animals inhabit environments in which food availability fluctuates or encounters with appropriate food items are rare and unpredictable; these species offer interesting opportunities to study physiological adaptations to fasting and starvation. When deprived of food, animals employ various behavioral, physiological, and structural responses to reduce metabolism, which prolongs the period in which energy reserves can cover metabolism. Such behavioral responses can include a reduction in spontaneous activity and a lowering in body temperature, although in later stages of food deprivation in which starvation commences, activity may increase as food-searching is activated. In most animals, the gastrointestinal tract undergoes marked atrophy when digestive processes are curtailed; this structural response and others seem particularly pronounced in species that normally feed at intermittent intervals. Such animals, however, must be able to restore digestive functions soon after feeding, and these transitions appear to occur at low metabolic costs.},

Some specific dietary components may also exert health benefits by inducing adaptive cellular stress responses. Indeed, recent findings suggest that several heavily studied phytochemicals exhibit biphasic dose responses on cells with low doses activating signaling pathways that result in increased expression of genes encoding cytoprotective proteins including antioxidant enzymes, protein chaperones, growth factors and mitochondrial proteins. Examples include: activation of the Nrf-2 -- ARE pathway by sulforaphane and curcumin; activation of TRP ion channels by allicin and capsaicin; and activation of sirtuin-1 by resveratrol.

Although hypothesized adverse effects of weight cycling on energy metabolism remain largely unsubstantiated, there is also a lack of epidemiologic evidence that intentional weight loss followed by regain of weight affects chronic-disease risk. In the limited studies of weight cycling and cancer, no independent effect on postmenopausal breast cancer but a modest enhancement of risk for renal cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been reported. An effect of either intermittent caloric restriction or fasting in protecting against cancer is not supported by the majority of rodent carcinogenesis experiments.

Accordingly, we review here animal and human evidence concerning ADF and the risk of certain chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We also compare the magnitude of risk reduction resulting from ADF with that resulting from CR. In terms of diabetes risk, animal studies of ADF find lower diabetes incidence and lower fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, effects that are comparable to those of CR. Human trials to date have reported greater insulin-mediated glucose uptake but no effect on fasting glucose or insulin concentrations. In terms of cardiovascular disease risk, animal ADF data show lower total cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations, a lower heart rate, improved cardiac response to myocardial infarction, and lower blood pressure. The limited human evidence suggests higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations and lower triacylglycerol concentrations but no effect on blood pressure. In terms of cancer risk, there is no human evidence to date, yet animal studies found decreases in lymphoma incidence, longer survival after tumor inoculation, and lower rates of proliferation of several cell types. The findings in animals suggest that ADF may effectively modulate several risk factors, thereby preventing chronic disease, and that ADF may modulate disease risk to an extent similar to that of CR. More research is required to establish definitively the consequences of ADF.},

Statistical analysis was performed using Chi squared, Fisher exact, Student t test, paired t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was defined at P {\textless} 0.05. The study showed that by the end of Ramadan fasting, there was a significant improvement in the mean levels of hemoglobin (Hb), TC, TG, HDL-c, LDL-c, TC/HDL, LDL/HDL, Lp (a), APA, APB, PT and systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that persisted for four weeks after fasting (P {\textless} 0.05). Ramadan fasting has not adversely affected leucocytic count or coagulation parameters (P {\textgreater} 0.05). There was also a significant association between dietary intake, SBP, DBP, weight, BMI, percent body fat and waist, fibrinogen and factor VII activity and TC, TG, HDL-c, LDL-c, LDL/HDL, Lp (a) and APB (P {\textless} 0.05). The model of Ramadan fasting could be followed as a behavior modification program to control or prevent atherogenicity because of its positive impact on the lipid pattern, blood count and coagulation parameters.},

The study was a randomized crossover design, with two 8-week treatment periods (with an intervening 11-week off-diet period) in which subjects consumed all of their calories for weight maintenance distributed in either 3 meals or 1 meal per day (consumed between 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm). Energy metabolism was evaluated at designated time points throughout the study by performing morning oral glucose tolerance tests and measuring levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, resistin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Subjects consuming 1 meal per day exhibited higher morning fasting plasma glucose levels, greater and more sustained elevations of plasma glucose concentrations, and a delayed insulin response in the oral glucose tolerance test compared with subjects consuming 3 meals per day. Levels of ghrelin were elevated in response to the 1-meal-per-day regimen. Fasting levels of insulin, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, resistin, and BDNF were not significantly affected by meal frequency. Subjects consuming a single large daily meal exhibit elevated fasting glucose levels and impaired morning glucose tolerance associated with a delayed insulin response during a 2-month diet period compared with those consuming 3 meals per day. The impaired glucose tolerance was reversible and was not associated with alterations in the levels of adipokines or BDNF.},

	abstract = {Asthma is an increasingly common disorder responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Although obesity is a risk factor for asthma and weight loss can improve symptoms, many patients do not adhere to low calorie diets and the impact of dietary restriction on the disease process is unknown. A study was designed to determine if overweight asthma patients would adhere to an alternate day calorie restriction (ADCR) dietary regimen, and to establish the effects of the diet on their symptoms, pulmonary function and markers of oxidative stress, and inflammation. Ten subjects with BMI \&gt; 30 were maintained for 8 weeks on a dietary regimen in which they ate ad libitum every other day, while consuming less than 20\% of their normal calorie intake on the intervening days. At baseline, and at designated time points during the 8-week study, asthma control, symptoms, and Quality of Life questionnaires (ACQ, ASUI, mini-AQLQ) were assessed and blood was collected for analyses of markers of general health, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured daily on awakening. Pre-and postbronchodilator spirometry was obtained at baseline and 8 weeks. Nine of the subjects adhered to the diet and lost an average of 8\% of their initial weight during the study. Their asthma-related symptoms, control, and QOL improved significantly, and PEF increased significantly, within 2 weeks of diet initiation; these changes persisted for the duration of the study. Spirometery was unaffected by ADCR. Levels of serum β-hydroxybutyrate were increased and levels of leptin were decreased on CR days, indicating a shift in energy metabolism toward utilization of fatty acids and confirming compliance with the diet. The improved clinical findings were associated with decreased levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides, striking reductions in markers of oxidative stress (8-isoprostane, nitrotyrosine, protein carbonyls, and 4-hydroxynonenal adducts), and increased levels of the antioxidant uric acid. Indicators of inflammation, including serum tumor necrosis factor-α and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, were also significantly decreased by ADCR. Compliance with the ADCR diet was high, symptoms and pulmonary function improved, and oxidative stress and inflammation declined in response to the dietary intervention. These findings demonstrate rapid and sustained beneficial effects of ADCR on the underlying disease process in subjects with asthma, suggesting a novel approach for therapeutic intervention in this disorder.},

	abstract = {It has been known since the early 1900s that restriction of dietary intake relative to the ad libitum (AL) level increases stress resistance, cancer resistance, and longevity in many species. Studies investigating these phenomena have used three paradigms for dietary restriction. In the first, the AL intake of a control group is measured, and an experimental group is fed less than that amount in a specified proportion, e.g., 40\%. In the second, food is provided AL to both the control and experimental groups: however, the experimental group is subjected to periods of fasting. Recent studies using this paradigm provide food every other day (EOD). Both of these paradigms have been in use since the early 1900s. A third paradigm that combines them was developed in the early 1970s: one or more days of fasting separate the provision of a limited amount of food. It was assumed for many years that the physiological responses to these paradigms were due exclusively to a net decrease in energy intake. Recently, however, it was found that some species and strains of laboratory animals, when fed AL every other day, are capable of gorging so that their net weekly intake is not greatly decreased. Despite having only a small deficit in energy intake relative to control levels, however, these animals experience enhanced longevity and stress resistance is enhanced in comparison to AL controls as much in animals enduring daily restriction of diet. These observations warrant renewed interest in this paradigm and suggest that comparisons of the paradigms and their effects can be used to determine which factors are critical to the beneficial effects of caloric restriction.},

	abstract = {It is established that calorie restriction (CR) increases the resistance of cells to various stressors such as oxidative damage, excitotoxins, mercury and acetaminophen. Alternate day feeding (ADF) may confer greater stress resistance than daily CR of 30\% or 40\%. A recent study in three strains of mouse showed that a fast of 48 or 60 h prevented toxic effects due to administration of doses 2-4 times the maximum human dose of etoposide, a chemotherapy agent which acts through increased oxidative stress. In addition, mice inoculated with neuroblastoma survived longer when pretreated with fasting, then given high dose etoposide, as well as not exhibiting toxicity. This increased survival was construed as evidence of differential stress resistance between normal and cancer cells, the cancer cells being only partially protected by the pretreatment fast. In clinical practice, increased differential stress resistance could lead to the use of much higher doses of chemotherapy agents, and in the absence of toxicity, make it possible to repeat the treatment to kill residual cancer cells. Humans are unlikely to comply with a total fast of longer than 24 or 48 h, which may be insufficient to activate the same gene expression process. Based on published data we estimate that an optimal time period for development of stress resistance is 2-3 weeks when alternate day feeding is employed. Our previously published experience suggests that 2-3 weeks of alternate day modified fast in which subjects eat ad libitum one day and {\textless}20\% of one's estimated caloric requirement the next will confer a similar stress resistance. Compliance with this diet is high and greater maintenance of body weight is feasible. We hypothesize that a pretreatment of 2-3 weeks with the alternate day modified fast will improve outcomes in cancer chemotherapy, decreasing morbidity and raising cure rates.},

	abstract = {Restricting caloric intake to 60-70\% of normal adult weight maintenance requirement prolongs lifespan 30-50\% and confers near perfect health across a broad range of species. Every other day feeding produces similar effects in rodents, and profound beneficial physiologic changes have been demonstrated in the absence of weight loss in ob/ob mice. Since May 2003 we have experimented with alternate day calorie restriction, one day consuming 20-50\% of estimated daily caloric requirement and the next day ad lib eating, and have observed health benefits starting in as little as two weeks, in insulin resistance, asthma, seasonal allergies, infectious diseases of viral, bacterial and fungal origin (viral URI, recurrent bacterial tonsillitis, chronic sinusitis, periodontal disease), autoimmune disorder (rheumatoid arthritis), osteoarthritis, symptoms due to CNS inflammatory lesions (Tourette's, Meniere's) cardiac arrhythmias (PVCs, atrial fibrillation), menopause related hot flashes. We hypothesize that other many conditions would be delayed, prevented or improved, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, brain injury due to thrombotic stroke atherosclerosis, NIDDM, congestive heart failure. Our hypothesis is supported by an article from 1957 in the Spanish medical literature which due to a translation error has been construed by several authors to be the only existing example of calorie restriction with good nutrition. We contend for reasons cited that there was no reduction in calories overall, but that the subjects were eating, on alternate days, either 900 calories or 2300 calories, averaging 1600, and that body weight was maintained. Thus they consumed either 56\% or 144\% of daily caloric requirement. The subjects were in a residence for old people, and all were in perfect health and over 65. Over three years, there were 6 deaths among 60 study subjects and 13 deaths among 60 ad lib-fed controls, non-significant difference. Study subjects were in hospital 123 days, controls 219, highly significant difference. We believe widespread use of this pattern of eating could impact influenza epidemics and other communicable diseases by improving resistance to infection. In addition to the health effects, this pattern of eating has proven to be a good method of weight control, and we are continuing to study the process in conjunction with the NIH.},

Plasma glucose concentration and hepatic glucose production decreased by 30\% with fasting (5.2 +/- 0.1 to 3.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/L and 11.8 +/- 0.5 to 8.2 +/- 0.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1, respectively, both P {\textless} 0.001) and glucose oxidation declined approximately 85\% (P {\textless} 0.01).

This provided substrate for the increase in fat oxidation (from 2.7 +/- 0.3 to 4.3 +/- 0.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P {\textless} 0.01), which contributed approximately 75\% of resting energy requirements after the 60-h fast and increased the supply of glycerol for gluconeogenesis. Proteolysis and protein oxidation increased approximately 50\% during fasting (P {\textless} 0.01 and P {\textless} 0.05, respectively). We conclude that the increase in FFA reesterification with fasting modulates FFA availability for oxidation and maximizes release of glycerol from triglyceride for gluconeogenesis.},

	abstract = {Chronic heart failure (CHF) is the major cause of death in the developed countries. Calorie restriction is known to improve the recovery in these patients; however, the exact mechanism behind this protective effect is unknown. Here we demonstrate the activation of cell survival PI3kinase/Akt and VEGF pathway as the mechanism behind the protection induced by intermittent fasting in a rat model of established chronic myocardial ischemia (MI). Chronic MI was induced in rats by occlusion of the left coronary artery. Two weeks later, the rats were randomly assigned to a normal feeding group (MI-NF) and an alternate-day feeding group (MI-IF). After 6 weeks of observation, we evaluated the effect of intermittent fasting on cellular and ventricular remodeling and long-term survival after CHF. Compared with the normally fed group, intermittent fasting markedly improved the survival of rats with CHF (88.5\% versus 23\% survival, P{\textless}0.05). The heart weight body weight ratio was significantly less in the MI-IF group compared to the MI-NF group (3.4+/-0.17 versus 3.9+/-0.18, P{\textless}0.05). Isolated heart perfusion studies exhibited well preserved cardiac functions in the MI-IF group compared to the MI-NF group (P{\textless}0.05). Molecular studies revealed the upregulation of angiogenic factors such asHIF-1-alpha (3010+/-350\% versus 650+/-151\%), BDNF (523+/-32\% versus 110+/-12\%), and VEGF (450+/-21\% versus 170+/-30\%) in the fasted hearts. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed increased capillary density (P{\textless}0.001) in the border area of the ischemic myocardium and synthesis VEGF by cardiomyocytes. Moreover fasting also upregulated the expression of other anti-apoptotic factors such as Akt and Bcl-2 and reduced the TUNEL positive apoptotic nuclei in the border zone. Chronic intermittent fasting markedly improves the long-term survival after CHF by activation through its pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and anti-remodeling effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although more than 80\% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown.
METHODS: We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99\% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated.
FINDINGS: Smoking (odds ratio 2.87 for current vs never, PAR 35.7\% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3.25 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49.2\% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1.91, PAR 17.9\%), diabetes (2.37, PAR 9.9\%), abdominal obesity (1.12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1.62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20.1\% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2.67, PAR 32.5\%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0.70, PAR 13.7\% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0.91, PAR 6.7\%), and regular physical activity (0.86, PAR 12.2\%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p{\textless}0.0001 for all risk factors and p=0.03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90\% of the PAR in men and 94\% in women.
INTERPRETATION: Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.},

To investigate the interactions of the GHRKO mutation with caloric restriction and EOD dietary interventions, we measured changes in the metabolic parameters oxygen consumption (VO2) and respiratory quotient produced by either long-term caloric restriction or EOD in male GHRKO and normal mice. GHRKO mice had increased VO2, which was unaltered by diet. In normal mice, EOD diet caused a significant reduction in VO2 compared with ad libitum (AL) mice during fed and fasted conditions. In normal mice, caloric restriction increased both the range of VO2 and the difference in minimum VO2 between fed and fasted states, whereas EOD diet caused a relatively static VO2 pattern under fed and fasted states. No diet significantly altered the range of VO2 of GHRKO mice under fed conditions. This provides further evidence that longevity-conferring diets cause major metabolic changes in normal mice, but not in GHRKO mice.},

	abstract = {This review analyzes the available literature on the impact of intermittent fasting (IF), a nutritional intervention, on different aspects of metabolism. The epidemic of metabolic disturbances, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome (MS), and diabetes mellitus type 2 has led to an increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, and affected patients might significantly benefit from modifications in nutritional habits. Recent experimental studies have elucidated some of the metabolic mechanisms involved with IF. Animal models have shown positive changes in glucose (lower plasma glucose and insulin levels) and in lipid metabolism (reduced visceral fat tissue and increased plasma adiponectin level), and an increased resistance to stress. Despite the limited number of samples studied, positive results have been reported on the impact of IF for human health. IF is reported to improve the lipid profile; to decrease inflammatory responses, reflected by changes in serum adipokine levels; and to change the expression of genes related to inflammatory response and other factors. Studies on obese individuals have shown that patient compliance was greater for IF than other traditional nutritional approaches (calorie restriction), and IF was found to be associated with low oxidative stress. Recent reports suggest that IF exerts a positive impact on the metabolic derangements commonly associated with cardiovascular diseases, and that it may be a viable and accessible intervention for most individuals. Therefore, further clinical studies are essential to test the effectiveness of IF in preventing and controlling metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Ramadan fasting on body composition, aerobic exercise performance and blood lactate, heart rate and perceived exertion in regularly trained young soccer players. Sixteen male soccer players participated in this study. Mean age, stature, body mass and training age of the players were 17.4±1.2 years, 175.4±3.6 cm, 69.6±4.3 kg and 5.1±1.3 years, respectively. During the Ramadan period, all subjects voluntarily chose to follow the fasting guidelines and abstained from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. Body composition, hydration status, dietary intake and sleep duration were assessed on four occasions: before Ramadan, at the beginning of Ramadan, at the end of Ramadan and 2 weeks after the end of Ramadan. On each occasion, aerobic exercise performance and blood lactate, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion responses of players were also determined during an incremental running test. Repeated measures of ANOVA revealed that body mass, percentage of body fat, fat-free mass, hydration status, daily sleeping time and daily energy and macronutrient intake of players did not vary significantly throughout the study period (p{\textgreater}0.05). However, players experienced a small but significant decrease in skinfold thicknesses over the course of the study (p{\textless}0.05). Although ratings of perceived exertion at submaximal workloads increased during Ramadan (p{\textless}0.05), blood lactate and heart rate responses had decreased by the end of Ramadan (p{\textless}0.05). In line with these changes, peak running performance and running velocity at anaerobic threshold also improved by the end of Ramadan (p{\textless}0.05). Improvements in aerobic exercise performance with time were probably due to the effects of pre-season training program that was performed after the break of the fast (Iftar) during the month of Ramadan. The results of the present study suggest that if regular training regimen, body fluid balance, daily energy intake and sleep duration are maintained as before Ramadan, Ramadan fasting does not have detrimental effects on aerobic exercise performance or body composition in young soccer players.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in abdominal fat distribution in the fasting month of Ramadan. Thirty-eight healthy volunteers (17 women and 21 men) who fasted in the month of Ramadan in 2002 were included in this prospective study. Waist, hip and thigh circumferences, weight and height of all subjects were measured. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-thigh ratio (WTR) and body mass index (BMI) were calculated for each subject. For assessing the fat distribution in the abdomen, computed tomography (CT) was performed. Both subcutaneous and visceral fat areas were calculated by the CT scanning technique. All of the calculations were done before (first measurement) and after (second measurement) Ramadan fasting and the changes were evaluated. No statistically significant differences were found in all subjects between the first and second measurements, which include total, subcutaneous and visceral fat areas, waist, hip and thigh circumferences, weight, BMI, WHR, and WTR (p {\textgreater} 0.05). In females and the individuals in their twenties, there was a significant decrease in visceral fat area (p {\textless} 0.05). Despite of the general opinion that supposes the change of weight during the fasting month of Ramadan, there were no significant differences in weight and abdominal fat distribution. However in female and young individuals, there was a reduction in visceral fat compartment. This could be due to fat redistribution, because they have more physical activity than males and older individuals.},
